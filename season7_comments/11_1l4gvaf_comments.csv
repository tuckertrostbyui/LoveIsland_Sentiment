"I think partially the issue was that Huda framed it like it was the worst thing in the world, like she was telling him she had an incurable disease.

If she had kept it light and told him she had a kid that she loved and she was a cool kid who liked Harry Potter or whatever, and just left it there, it would probably not have been so disastrous. But she legit made it seem like the end of the world **herself.**

"This might be an unpopular or controversial opinion, but I don’t think “Love Island” is the type of dating show to go on if you have a child. Generally speaking most of the contestants are in their early to mid 20s. I’d say about half (if that) of the contestants are REALLY  looking for love and the rest are there for popularity, stirring the pot, and having a fun summer. If I was on Love Island when I was  23-24 years old and there was someone on there with a child I probably wouldn’t pursue them either….. I say all that to say, if Jeremiah decides not to pursue Huda because she has a child I don’t think he should be judged or crucified for it.",231,1749177263.0,EconomistFriendly629,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

okay so ace does NOT like jeremiah. whether it’s bcs he’s guarding huda or even just bcs he thinks jeremiah is fake. he definitely implied this sentiment to taylor at the end of this episode. regardless, that’s gunna boil over into some mess.

i think olandria’s reaction to taylor standing up was iffy bcs it’s day 3, however, she has solidified herself as my favorite from the way she owned up to her reaction. she essentially came back and said she was trippin a bit lol. her and taylor have the best communication. both of them know how to speak up for themselves.

huda & olandria also resolved their little snafu quickly. love that. at the end of the day, i still think folks were doing too much on olandria. like many of us SAID: it wasn’t that serious.

chelley likes ace and he likes her. like a bombshell came in and he’s made it abundantly clear she’s still his number one choice, even if he is friendly. even if we feel like chelley needs someone else, that’s definitely her best connection in the villa atm, and they should get to explore that.",73,1749179642.0,EyeHuman,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

"Ace gives me a strange vibe. The way he approaches Chelley feels rehearsed so I can't get a genuine read from him there. His weird vibe is further compounded by the fact that he seems overly concerned in meddling in Jeremiah and Huda's couple - asking if Huda being with two people in one day was weird to Jeremiah, gossiping with Taylor about how many people Jeremiah told he loved them. Why didn't you ask him straight up about that? You weren't shy to asking him if he was worried he couldn't satisfy her?? He even asked Taylor why he wasn't pursuing Huda but... didn't you (Ace) kiss her in the challenge? Why arent you pursuing her? 

I do think Huda and Jeremiah have a bit of an obsessive streak but I think they both like it tbh. And last time I checked they are two consenting adults, but Ace wants Huda as an option.",68,1749213007.0,Necessary_Maize_9219,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

Super interested to see where Jeremiah goes from here.  his communication skills will be on full display because Huda didn’t put him in the best position to respond and idk if Huda will give him the space and time to evaluate what he needs in a relationship. My hope is that they revisit the convo in the morning and give each other space buuuuuut it’s LI, so I lowkey expect one crash out.",66,1749227242.0,Glittering-Bus-9971,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

Also, as a toddler mom, I don't know how it doesn't come up. It's just so central to where you are at this stage of life it is sort of a betrayal to someone getting to know you. Imagine just not saying anything about your career and skirting questions about it to make sure someone's ready - like it's just a weird idea.

"This ep made me like Ace a lot more. I think I judged him as too cocky & young originally, but him clocking Jeremiah as a love bombing weirdo (AND pulling aside Taylor for that specifically, trying to talk to a male friend about it) I really liked. Maybe the bar is in hell but it’s rare on this show to see men call out bad behavior like that, even rarer to other men. NOW—If this is all because he wants Huda I’ll eat my words… but I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt. (He’s also so cute, 90s fine. That giant ACE back piece is crazy but I digress)

Other random thoughts: Chelley needs another bi bombshell sent in for her IMMEDIATELY. Love Olandria, besides being absolutely stunning her emotional maturity is admirable af and she’s so sweet. Nic and Cierra are cute. Belle-a is on the wrong show and I feel for her tbh. Austin seems like he has no brain cells… maybe the pool chemicals got to him 

I don’t even wanna comment on Huda and Jeremiah. Jeremiah has something sinister inside of him and Huda is a little too proud for me, idk. I’m triggered by the whole situation bc I’ve lived it lmao",110,1749177040.0,realgrandpa,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

I lowkey feel like Huda brought up Jeremiah love bombing her now as a shield. She knew she was about to tell him about the baby and she just wanted a shield in case it turned out bad so she can say see I knew he was just love bombing me! … But maybe the 10 people really did throw her off - it’s certainly a good bit I just didn’t think it was enough to make her start questioning if their connection was real or if he was lovebombing her. For the record I do think he is lol but she’s been saying that she loves how obsessed he is but maybe it feels less special if you think he was the same way with 10 other people.,62,1749194598.0,One_Caramel7003,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

"Here’s my hot takes (grab a snack):

1. is Taylor just genuinely confused and doesn’t know how this show works? Kissing someone in a game isn’t the same as standing up to re-couple with someone that you’ve BARELY spoken to

2. I think Austin embellished his numbers. there is NO WAY there are that many girls willing to hop on that boy

3. it’s okay to sleep with 50-100 women but all the girls’ body counts were under 20 and Cierra had to explain herself!? BYE. this happened last season and I’m sick of the misogyny and double standards. men’s egos are so fragile

4. This one might get people mad but Ace is moving weird and it’s rubbing me the wrong way. I know he’s a Leo and they love attention but he’s always stirring the pot and SPECIFICALLY about Jeremiah and Huda. the fact he kissed Huda in the challenge then tried to make it seem like she was lying about getting up to kiss anyone and THEN questioned their connection AGAIN in this episode makes me feel like he’s a little bothered that Huda is the one girl in the villa that has shown him 0 interest. he had a valid point with Jeremiah telling so many girls he loved them but why is he always trying to put Huda and Jeremiah in the hot seat? focus on yourself. 

5. it was so nasty to me when the guys were questioning Huda and Chelley about sleeping with 2 people in one day when a few of them had. then MAGICALLY it was okay when Chelley said it was two girls? gross. people’s sexualities are not for your fetish. 

6. I get why Huda wanted to keep having a child to herself. A lot of mothers feel like they want their identity to be more than just being a mom. She didn’t want to be seen as that first. In the real world, I always prefer people tell someone they’re dating that they have kids early on but being on a dating show where things move fast makes this situation different. I ride for Huda and I hope to god Jeremiah’s reaction doesn’t disappoint me. 

7. Idk how to feel about Nic but him being a Pisces makes complete sense. Total lover boy. I’d tread lightly with him knowing that he’s so quick to fall for people and possibly switch up. 

8. I need new men (heavy on the MAN not a boy part) in the villa and I hope the women take control and beat these boys at their own game.

The way he’s moving does not feel super authentic to me either, and worse he’s not even entertaining with it.

Ace grew on me a lot this episode. Making breakfast for the girls who got stood up. Clocking Jeremiah’s love bombing. Stirring the pot. Very messy boots.

Nic and Cierra are cute for now, but it’s giving fwb. IMO she’s too good for him (she’s carrying their convos, and I cringed when he was pretending to love Avatar while not knowing who Aang is). Also seems like he might not have his heart in it because he’s more into the chase. And Belledasha…girl you’re sweet but this is not the environment for you, please apply for the Bachelor next time.

On the low I hope Cierra and Chelley couple up. It’s pride month and I wanna see some gay shit on my screen!!!

"Wow some more crazy stuff happening on love island with each episode. 

I love how at the beginning Olandria was able to clear the air with Huda and continue to be good island mates with each other. 

In general I’ve loved the women on this show. All 10/10 in looks and personality (except for Yulissa who is no longer here). 

Once again my bias couple remains with Olandria and Taylor. I think despite the small argument they had; I still think they’re attracted to each other enough to continue their coupling. Double Geminis FTW ♊️♊️♊️♊️♊️

It’s great to see Belle-A tell her honest feelings to Nic regarding the recoupling. I wish she can find a man who can value her for the great woman she is (maybe Charlie?). Nic should stop BS’ing his mind that he’s 50/50; he clearly enjoys being with Cierra more than with Belle-A. 

It’s great seeing the blossoming connection between Ace and Shelley. Their banter feels effortless. I would be surprised if they don’t recouple with each other. 

Oh boy. Seeing how that episode ended between Huda and Jeremiah, yeah they’re not making it. Jeremiah will jump for the next female bombshell the first chance he gets. If producers are rigging the show by telling Huda to delay her mom secret reveal until episode 3, they should be ashamed of themselves. Please Huda, find someone else who will cherish your motherhood more than Jeremiah ….

I don’t know, Charlie is falling flat in terms of being a male bombshell. He’s definitely not like Miguel from S6.

Yeah Austin is getting the boot at next recoupling. No further comments needed.

Usually moms have a bit more of a mature womanly aura about them 

And it’s wild because right before she confessed to him, she asked what his deal breakers were and he gave her two incredibly articulate and insightful answers 

1) when a woman has no long term close friends it shows she isn’t capable of maintaining and forming good relationships 
2) he needs a family oriented person

nic: cutie and he's funny, him and ceirra are lowk cute but i don't think they will last long. he gives major fboy energy. i LOVE ceirra, i hope we get to see more of her and chelley. love them tgt!

chelley: literally a doll, one of the prettiest people to exist. even though i love the banter & chemistry bw ace and chelley, she deserves better. i hope we get a bombshell for her. or maybe ceirra&chelley??

ace: messy, charismatic, funny and a perfect LI material. i kinda want to see the beef bw him and jermaih. he's definitely in for the long run.

taylor: ugh, ola deserves sm better. she's being way too sweet with him. he's kind of annoying and giving nothing rn.

ola: loveeeee, need a new man for her. she seems very mature, i love the way she handled both the huda and taylor situation. also kinda want her and nic tgt.

"I can’t tell if Charlie is getting a good edit or the girls were just never feeling him but their reaction is not matching what we’re seeing on the screen. His person isn’t in that villa.

Belle-A is pulling a Quinn from Daria. Drop the accent, stop worrying about portraying a certain image, and there may actually an interesting and emotionally mature person underneath. 

I have no idea why these girls are shocked by Austin. The man looks like that in Florida. What else are girls supposed to do with him? Talk?

Nic and Cierra seem like a good fit but I think Cierra can do better. I don’t mind Nic but losing interest when you get what you want only to chase what you can’t have is a red flag.

Speaking of red flags: Ace is a chaos gremlin here for a good time. He’ll push everyone’s buttons and laugh while doing so. If Chelley is looking for something serious then she needs to look elsewhere. I don’t know *where*, but elsewhere.

Taylor remains on of the most emotionally mature men. Him and Olandria seem to agree they *should* be connecting but it’s just not happening.

Jeremiah surprised me. I think he may be more genuine than I gave him credit for. 

Huda is coming off as performative. She’s either to in her own head, actively trying to give a certain image, or both. Her comments during the game really rubbed me the wrong way.

If Jeremiah is upset about her having a child it will be because she waited. While I sympathize with her fears she’s been treating this like a big secret. People are going to act accordingly.

"Ace is so funny and honestly a home run OG boy to cast. I don’t think he really liked Jeremiah to begin with and sees through the  “nice guy” persona and thinks he is also love bombing the shit out of Huda. If Jeremiah fumbles his reaction to Huda’s motherhood I can see Ace using that as an opportunity to slide in and be the shoulder to cry on for her…tea. I honestly tho do see the next episode just showing that Jeremiah actually isn’t upset at all and is relieved and maybe thought she was gonna say something worse like maybe she was still married or something. I’m so curious how he’s gonna handle it tho and speak about it to the boys specifically.

I always hate the body count challenges because there’s always something off with how the dudes react to the girls 😭 like there was way too much focus on Huda saying she’s slept with two dudes in one day before like it’s not that deep, and what she said was true…who cares. But then suddenly it’s not a big deal if Chelley has done it because it was two girls. Idk as a bi girl myself there’s always been an invalidation of when a woman is with another woman and it was kinda perfectly displayed there with how much they cared about Huda vs Chelley. Also Austin is so gross and such a liar…I don’t believe for a second he’s been with four women in one day and also you cannot convince me he knows where the clit is 😭

Belle-a…I still fear this is not the show for you. The confrontation on the dock with Nic was so awkward. Also Nic is quite literally the epitome of a himbo. I still can’t believe he hadn’t pulled aside Belle-a (or planned to at all the next day lol) to talk to her about his intentions with Cierra. I just feel like the chemistry between them is forced because I think he finds Belle-a attractive but her personality is awkward and unnatural. I don’t think Nic is at all who she’s looking for. Honestly I think her personality would mash well best with Austin if Austin wasn’t a gross pig.

Also I agree with Olandria’s point but also I think it’s too early for her to stand her ground. Taylor was willing to basically recouple completely and potentially risk Olandria being single and vulnerable. Olandria kissed Ace and didn’t put Taylor at any risk. It’s more so that Taylor didn’t think at all about what could happen to Olandria by doing that than his thing about “putting himself out there” or whatever. I just don’t think he’s very thoughtful at all but maybe that will change with the more time he spends in a couple with Olandria.",22,1749176580.0,janna_,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

""How many kids?""

Taylor - needs more screen time.

Nic - always looks like he’s in pain or confused. He also needs a better haircut for this curly hair.

When Taylor stood up I just laughed, like boy if you don’t sit your ass down 🤣 

Nic does seem to be a little awkward when it comes to conflict, but also I thought it may have been awkward because he didn’t realize Bella would be so hurt over their 48 hour “connection” that wasn’t even really a connection.

"Eh I don’t think Ace is jealous of him at all. I think Ace senses that the way Jeremiah’s moving is inauthentic (because it is) so he’s pushing him to see if he will be authentic. For instance with the Huda thing, I don’t think Ace cared that she slept with two people in one day, but because Jeremiah seemed shocked by it during the game (he even said in his confessional he was surprised) so Ace wanted to see if Jeremiah would own up to the fact that he was bothered. But of course Jeremiah wouldn’t and he immediately tapped into this performative “I’m the perfect man” act; where “of course he’s not bothered all of his girls orgasm so it’s not a problem”. And at the end Ace wasn’t talking shit he just clocked Jeremiah’s game. He said the exact same thing Huda and the girls said which is that Jeremiah is a love bomber. He has only known her for 72 hours and is acting in love. It’s weird and toxic. And when he and Huda were speaking at the very end and she asked him to describe what he likes in a woman and all he could come up with was you, should tell you everything you need to know.",3,1749193300.0,LuckyCharms442,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

"From my experience, when black men say they like foreign/exotic women, they typically mean a WOC with light skin. It also usually (but not always) excludes black women and doesn’t mean the woman actually has to be from a different country or have an accent. For example Huda vs Cierra. While they are both non-black WOC (at least to my knowledge),  a lot of men would consider Huda “exotic” and not Cierra because Cierra has darker skin. Some men would consider Caro and Kyra from Season 1 exotic while some would exclude Caro because she has more distinctive black features. 
Personally I think the term is bullshit and just a way to say that they don’t like darker skinned black women or certain types of white women.",63,1749210102.0,mccurdy_gang,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion

"It’s a big deal. It’s weird she waited so long.

She legally has to stay in her state until the child is 18 so the father can visit. 
This scenario could happen with Huda and Jeremiah, hypothetically speaking. 

The thing about dating someone with kids that most people don’t think of, is you’re not just adding them into your life, you’re also adding their other parent into your life.

A single mom wanting love sounds totally normal to me. This specific show may not be ideal, but she's willing to play the game. I'd also be incredibly shocked if she's the only parent pre-villa entry in the entire franchise.

Bella however, entered the show Love Island as a ridiculously beautiful cheek kisses only, self proclaimed Christian girl. The show about hot people in little and/or revealing clothing all day making out. Even if she decides to open up and start making out all willy nilly, that would make her seem inauthentic to herself.

"Yes and no.

I know i certainly picked up some artifacts in the accent/dialect based on weird stuff like that when i was young.  Started cursing a lot fucking more when i was doing construction work.  Picked up weird regional things when i was out for college down east across the country.  Including a few Ontario things because every second person was just a rich kid from there.  My sister picked up all sorts of weird little things when she was in college on the west coast and i relentlessly make fun of her for it when certain words come up.

A lot of it is just...sensitivity and mimicry of the prevailing dialect.  You spend enough time around Love Island Villa and you'll *like* be saying it's *like* literally *like* a virus.

My accent is already just a mishmash to begin with though, because my mother moved around so much as a kid.  So already steeped in weird ""Army brat in a different country"" nonsense.  So i've got artifacts from a dozen different places before i even started getting to creating my own artifacts by moving around the country.

I feel like the places she mentioned, reads like Air Force brat a little bit.  So maybe that's what's going on?


That said...there *is* something really odd with the modal switching of the accents.  There's something unnatural there.  So it's probably just performative.  But still...i'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt.  For now.

It can signal colorism but it can also just mean they like mixed or light skin people which is not a bad thing. People like what they like. Being attracted to light skin mixed people is not always fetishizing. That implies that mixed people are only of value because they are mixed. It could just be an appreciation of what they find beautiful just like people who find black people beautiful or Asian people beautiful. Fetishization happens but sometimes conversations are simply about what someone is attracted to. No one gets mad when someone says they are attracted to blondes or tall men or guys with accents like Charlie. Even if Jeremiah as a black man was solely attracted to middle eastern girls like Huda that is okay. It’s not a slight on anyone who doesn’t fit that description.,2,1749236060.0,otherboywriter,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion
Not at all. I get called exotic all the time. It was an objectifying conversation but ultimately harmless on Jeremiah’s side imo. Ace on the other hand was trying to stir the pot as he did in regards to Jeremiah the whole episode. Exotic to guys usually means not black and not white.

If she leans into this ‘big/lil sis’ vibe they have going versus trying to force a PPG, she and Belledasha COULD be the next Blnd Mmnts and Chelley, Ola and Cierra could be the ‘next PPG’ and boom, they’ve accomplished the same setup that worked last year in a way that feels more natural than orchestrated) and I think a large part of that is because she does feel like she’s playing the Love Island *game* while the other girls are simply on Love Island.",1,1749224898.0,zeuswasahoe,1l4gvaf,Season 7 - Episode 3 - Post Episode Discussion
