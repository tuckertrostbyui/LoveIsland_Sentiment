-“Everyone calls us mom & dad” who??

-Edit: “I think Amaya has an ulterior motive” Do you know what ulterior means? Her motives are not a secret she is trying to get to know Jeremiah as she should as a bombshell.

"Other thoughts

I was NOT expecting to be so invested in this Nic, Cierra and Belle-A love triangle but it got good real quick. I really liked him and Cierra but his physical attraction to Belle-A, in his words ""his type"",  is really strong and now that she is finally opening up and showing she is ready to take their connection to the next level, Belledasha might really be making a comeback from being down 3-1. I know many aren't the most fond of her but it takes a lot to be one of the youngest, least experienced compared to everyone else and finally put herself out there like she did. This is the character development I like to see. 

I also really like Cierra, her vibe and chats and I want her to stay to find her nerdy king bc that certainly isn't Nic. 

Not to be mean but I was expecting a little more for the bombshells? Amaya seems cool and pretty, she won't be a pushover either by any means but I don't see her turning Jeremiah or Ace's heads from Huda or Chelley for max drama. Same for Hannah putting a dent into the Nic equation but she seems like a good convo at least. Austin and Charlie were about as interesting and animated as they've been the whole season talking to her. And also I'm ngl, I'm actually happy someone seems into Charlie bc his chat with the guys earlier in the episode about his struggles in the villa was so sad to watch 😭.",55,1749270087.0,neongem,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"I know it’s not happening unless Jeremiah pulls the ultimate switch but Huda needs to go home for her own health. 

I imagine everything feels more real and important because she has a child at home but if someone can’t handle challenges on Day Four then this format isn’t for them. 

She’s cried every day. She’s constantly stressed. She’s spitting vitriol about anyone even looking in Jeremiah’s direction. She’s being intimate with him before telling him she has a kid only to imply he’s hurting her for being a mother if he even talks to someone else.

This doesn’t even touch the joke/not joke of her calling her and Jeremiah Mom and Dad. 

Hannah is finally someone Austin and Charlie can pursue and Amaya seems cool.

"I definitely don’t agree with huda and her behavior. It was immature and childish for someone who claims to be “the most emotionally mature” and the “mom” of the villa. Also, telling jeremiah and then not even letting him talk to anyone else about it was kinda isolating him. I’m not surprised he told belldasha because that man looked like he wanted to talk about it so bad with someone but couldn’t talk to any of the boys. Also calling the girls “sisters” is very emotionally manipulative and I’m glad chelly and ciera didn’t buy into it by being mean to the bombshells on her behalf.

However, I also feel bad for huda because her age and lack of relationship experience is showing. This was definitely not the show for her because if she was open and getting to know all the guys people would judge her for leaving her child behind to have a hot girl summer. But if she tries to be closed off in hopes of finding a step father for her child people are going to judge her for not playing the game.

- this “baseball” challenge is seriously disgusting. not in the kissing, just mad sticky. 
- belle-a is growing on me. her personality felt hollow before but i think she was just shy! she’s the youngest one and i’m interested to see where this love triangle goes. 
- speaking of belle-a… that kiss in the evening with nic was INTENSE. nic is playing GAMES. while i think everyone should still be open this early on, he needs to be more clear with both girls that he is equally interested in them both. based on his “chat” (makeout) with cierra, she has no idea how much he’s feeling belle-a as well! gonna be messy
- i fear austin is going to end up as the guy who stays single/friendzoned all season. his voice & personality just aren’t doing it for me (and it seems the other girls)",29,1749305179.0,moose-paint,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"Ace likes to shake things up more for reactions, than real feelings. The only person Ace seems to have some interest in is Chelle. But he wants to play that lightly for now because if it can go far he doesn’t want to ruin it by diving in and then hurting her feelings when someone else comes in.

In terms of Huda, I think he kissed her previously out of curiosity and to also play with Jeremiah’s head to see what he’s thinking. Because Jeremiah is so pressed on Huda after a short time and was giving closed off energy, I think Ace saw through that and is like this man is being inauthentic. Objectively Ace could probably tell Jeremiah is attractive and a lot of pretty girls will also come in, so why isn’t he trying to be a little bit open. And then when the question game came out and Huda said she had 2 male partners in a day, Ace was surprised that he didn’t have any concerns about that. Unfortunately double standards do exist ( even though it’s a bit gross on both sides) but I think Ace was expecting him to say something like that didn’t rub him entirely the right way. So he pressed it and started thinking he’s set on playing safe and he’s not being real!

After episode 4, Jeremiah basically let it out that he’s not being authentic either! There was no fault against him for processing the big reveal that Huda is a mother, but not too long after, he was simply like “when we win” Like oh reallllly!  He’s was thinking this is the perfect twist in their script and now if he stays with her they’ll really win. The gameplaying is simply too high with that one! I get it’s in the back of everyone’s head but at least actually play the game and get to know people! Don’t be calculated like that.

"I really hate the language being used this season, shit like “high value” and whatnot. Not to mention, Huda’s reaction to one of the guy’s (i think Austin’s?) body count was so disappointing lol.

Honestly the guys’ reaction to the girls’ stats were disappointing too, but that’s always been the case tbh.
BelledashA is free to do whatever she wants with her body but I just find it a little silly to be regurgitating purity culture rhetoric. I’m glad she stepped out of her shell too but I find it shocking that she can’t see that Nic is thinking w his wiener and will choose the girl that he’s most likely to bed the soonest.

"Belle-A’s adoption of purity culture has made Sierra feel the need to emphasize herself sexually to win Nic over. 

I know I’m about to get think piece allegations but I doooo need to talk about this. 

Sierra verbalized to the boys earlier in the day that she’s nervous about Nic’s perception of the contrast in her and Belle-A’s numbers of sexual partners. You could hear Sierra hoping Nic isn’t the type of guy to consider the difference in sexual openness and experience between them. 

However, multiple different times throughout this episode, Nic inadvertently revealed that he is valuing sexual connection and that he is viewing Belle-A as a conquest. Saying Sierra kissing Nic made her 80/40 over Belle-A, but then Belle-A kissing him made her move back up to 50/50, saying he wanted to be the first to kiss her before any other guy in the villa, hitting a fake home run after their make out session, etc etc etc. Regardless of whether Nic is consciously aware of this sentiment or not, we are seeing glimpses of his beliefs through micro interactions. 

Sierra is watching this happen and, in my opinion, reacted the way she did in the evening as a direct result. She learned further into her ‘identity’ as being more sexually open during her interactions with Nic. Whether she intended it or not, this was an effort to win him over. 

I feel like we are watching in live time how purity culture harms women…both the woman actively engaging in it and the women around them. 

Super hard to watch, esp as the culture at large is moving back to that direction :(",61,1749308087.0,purpleonionlover,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

- producers give the new bombshells first choice, hannah chooses charlie and amaya chooses jeremiah (possibly for immunity considering they’ve only been here max 2 days)
- taylor goes for olandria (they’re kind of overlooked as a couple, they’re both mature and very sweet with each other)
- nic will end up choosing belle-a (he keeps reiterating that she’s his type and now that she’s open to getting physical with him his head is definitely turned)
- ace will end up choosing chelley (yes i considered the fact that he might go for huda just to be messy but imo he seems to really have something with chelley with how he keeps reiterating that “she’s something special” and also i don’t want chelley dumped from the island lol)
- austin will go for cierra (seems to like her and also i want cierra to be saved so that a good bombshell can come in for her)

TBD on the bombshells but off of first impressions I like Amaya a lil more. Hannah seems sweet she’s just not my kinda personality.

My Recoupling predictions: Ace/Chelley, Taylor/Olandria, Nic/Belle-A, Jeremiah/Huda, Charlie/Hannah, Austin/Cierra

Dumped: Amaya - I don’t want her to be gone yet cuz she could be interesting when it comes to Jeremiah & Huda but if the guys are choosing I think Austin might go with Cierra since she chose him in the bases challenge.

My Minor Takeaway: I like that we have the Nic/Belle-A/Cierra love triangle. I’m not too invested in it (nor do I think many ppl are) but they’re all likeable enough so it’s just kinda fun background “drama” and less serious than people are taking some other things.

huda i’m ??? “do you not see what me and jerimiah have?” girl SHE JUST GOT HERE. and she’s a bombshell, she don’t give a damn about no “feelings” you developed for jeremiah during the past four days. i know ppl say that 3 days can feel like 3 weeks in the villa but damn. while the other girls may have looked off-put by their first choice kissing the bombshells, they had no where near the level of disgust on their face as huda.

i also think this plays into the weird “girls girls” narrative that if the other girls were true “girls girls” they wouldn’t bat an eye at jeremiah. huda thinks the girls and incoming bombshells owe her some sort of loyalty and should avoid “her man” at all costs. i feel like if jeremiah did go for a bombshell, she would put all the blame on the bombshell and act like jeremiah was innocent.

She came in citing she was a Christian, praying before bed (which they cut out most of), & having firm boundaries about kissing. I wonder if production is responsible for the switch up.",3,1749281495.0,snflwrjeff,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

Jeremiah is not ready to be with a woman with a small child. He looked scared honestly. And if Huda keeps seeing him then she’s turning a blind eye to it because it’s so obvious. if they stick together on the show then come out to the real world and he breaks it off real quick because he’s not ready for the responsibility of her lifestyle. While he wants to go out to events and parties after the show while Huda has to stay home some nights with her child. She’s going to crack that he won’t stay home too. He’s 100% in it to win. He knows from past seasons he has to stay with an OG and not mess around to be able to get americas vote. If she doesn’t switch up then she has 0 respect for herself or her child or maybe she’s only in it to win it too….,2,1749288601.0,jamert132,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"I was super late on watching tonight guys so here’s everything I would have commented all in one lengthy post from start to finish: 


1. Jeremiah handled it better then expected - but still not great, he was honest abt the fact that for now he still likes her but it could change I guess 

2. Belldasha’s chat w/ nic at the fire place was really hard to watch imo - she was passive aggressively and awkwardly flirting, although he was “flirting” back his body language was off and his eyes kept darting to get out of the convo 

3. Ciera is such mature and I appreciate her straight forward ness. Felt bad for Nic tho cuz he’s clearly conflicted - probably currently wishing he wasn’t so handsome !!😂

  4. Austin actually made me giggle for saying he exposed himself with his very busy sex life lol … don’t downvote me

5.Jeremiah’s teeth are real! He had Invisalign in when Huda came into bed

6. Chelley was great for being honest with Austin, he handled being friendzoned/rejection way better than anticipated 
 
7. Charlie’s being hard on himself, don’t worry bby someone’s coming for u 

8. This game is LITERALLY messy as hell and ACE IS A HORN DOG LOL. Will use any excuse to snog these ladies 

9. NICS FACE WHEN BELLA KISSED CHARLIE KILLED MEEEE - standing there like an NPC LMFAO

10. Huda really needs to relax tbh 

11. HANNAH HAS WAYYYYY TOO MUCH BOTOX HER FACE IS SO PUFFY AND DOESNT MOVE 😟 she’s only 23

12. Chelley is always the voice of reason !!!

13. Who did that to poor Bella’s lips 😭🤣 no wonder she was holding off on a kiss. lol I bet it was Ace 

14. Anytime I watch Love Island I feel FOMO for not being a man. Everything with them is so seriously unserious and I wish being a girl was that lighthearted 😭😭😭

15. Did Hannah just say she likes making sex tapes ?!?!? LMFAO GIRL…

16. Amiya is beautiful but her lisp is distracting for me 

17. The way Huda is acting is really not cute, especially when meanwhile Amiya is speaking so eloquently to Ace - and like, she has watched this show before right? lol

18. Belldasha talks much more obnoxiously when flirting and it’s obviously because she’s nervous but still can the producers let her know 

19. I’m really confused what is making Nic change his mind tho so much. Was it really just the kiss with Bella? Cuz him and Ciera seem to have more chemistry. 

20. Olandria is SO funny to me - just her mannerisms and everything killllls me 

21. I feel really bad for Ciera. She seems like such a cool down to earth girl, but she also seems like she gives off a really sexy aura which initially makes guys really attracted to her. Perhaps Nic realizes that he doesn’t mind Bella’s boundaries and that once he broke down her walls, he really really likes her . Ugh I feel bad for Ciera cuz I think she’s gonna get let down and I think she’s knows. She almost lured Nic to the Photo Booth and was super Handsy to redominate her territory 

22. Also I just added this in last second cuz I realized I had nothing to say abt Taylor - WTF is going on with him and Olandria?? Can they stop playing friendship island pls. Producers need to tell them to stop hanging out with the guys and girls too much 


My guesses on Sunday night :
-Ace couples up with Chelley or Amiya 
-Amiya chats with Austin and Jeremiah
-Charlie and Hannah couple up 
-Some kind of confrontation between Huda/Jeremiah and Amiya

-Nic recouples with Belle-A

"I don’t know. For some reason today, I’m in a bad mood and that may have affected my enjoyment of this episode. 

I’m not going to go over every couple. But I’ll highlight certain people and how much I think of them either positively or negatively: 

-Belle-A (positive): I love how she is willing to get out her comfort zone when doing the challenge; now that will definitely make Nic’s decision very hard in terms of who he re-couples with (arguable the most intriguing love triangle of Nic, Belle-A and Cierra)

-Huda (negative): to an extent, I can understand her worries/concerns regarding the bombshells; but I was taken aback by her demeaning comments about them behind their backs. It’s giving serial killer yandere vibes; that type of energy I would not touch with a ten foot pole.

"This reminds of Amy and Curtis of UK s5. 

Spoilers: >!Amy and Curtis were a long term couple that were actually called mom and dad by other islanders. Before Casa, there was a public vote and they placed in the bottom of 3, but survived. He didn’t couple up w anyone in Casa but decided he wasn’t sexually attracted to Amy anymore. If you put the pieces together, he stayed w Amy thinking it was the best move to win, but after the public vote he realized they weren’t winning and could actually ditch her.!<

I think a similar situation could happen where Huda and Jeremiah get voted into the bottom 3 and he realizes he won’t win w her. Then, he will tell her that being a mom is the deal breaker.",2,1749263628.0,DependentAd5483,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"Kinda agree until the last part. Belle-A not wanting to be intimate(kissing, sex, etc) is not something she should be ashamed of. I grew up as a non-christian in the Bible Belt so I do get how toxic and “dictatorial” religion can be to a society/an individual. I also agree she shouldn’t feel bad if she does want to kiss, etc (which is seems like she didn’t which is good). The bigger concern is WHY she is doing it. If it is to appease a man (which the whole her being excited about 50/50 kinda confirms) then yeah, that’s sad she’s sabotaging her values for the wrong reasons but that’s not “purity culture being bad”, she is allowed to want to not kiss/have sex relatively soon (though she shouldn’t be on the show). 

However, I do agree purity culture is responsible for Chelley acting that way (which is sad), Nics interest being a conquest, and also why Belle-A feels the need to push her limits. I just don’t think she should feel bad for having those values though. It’s not like she’s judging other women for kissing/their body counts or anything either.",2,1749333762.0,reddituser889088,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

This made it pretty obvious IMO that everyone already knew... which, like... would make sense. I think the others knew Huda's ""secret,"" at least some of them, probably including Jeremiah. It seemed like Dasha and Jeremiah were celebrating that Huda finally told him, so they obviously knew there was a big secret to tell. How hard would it be to figure it out, especially when we know 2 of the girls knew for a fact already? So was he pretending not to know during the reveal?

The problem is not “not opening her legs” as you so helpfully if misogynisticallly put it. It’s about why. If someone is not engaging in sexual behavior because they aren’t interested or aren’t comfortable or have different preferences or whatever then I’m all for it.
