"Other thoughts

I was NOT expecting to be so invested in this Nic, Cierra and Belle-A love triangle but it got good real quick. I really liked him and Cierra but his physical attraction to Belle-A, in his words ""his type"",  is really strong and now that she is finally opening up and showing she is ready to take their connection to the next level, Belledasha might really be making a comeback from being down 3-1. I know many aren't the most fond of her but it takes a lot to be one of the youngest, least experienced compared to everyone else and finally put herself out there like she did. This is the character development I like to see. 

I also really like Cierra, her vibe and chats and I want her to stay to find her nerdy king bc that certainly isn't Nic. 

Not to be mean but I was expecting a little more for the bombshells? Amaya seems cool and pretty, she won't be a pushover either by any means but I don't see her turning Jeremiah or Ace's heads from Huda or Chelley for max drama. Same for Hannah putting a dent into the Nic equation but she seems like a good convo at least. Austin and Charlie were about as interesting and animated as they've been the whole season talking to her. And also I'm ngl, I'm actually happy someone seems into Charlie bc his chat with the guys earlier in the episode about his struggles in the villa was so sad to watch üò≠.",55,1749270087.0,neongem,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

This doesn‚Äôt even touch the joke/not joke of her calling her and Jeremiah Mom and Dad.

"I definitely don‚Äôt agree with huda and her behavior. It was immature and childish for someone who claims to be ‚Äúthe most emotionally mature‚Äù and the ‚Äúmom‚Äù of the villa.

Also calling the girls ‚Äúsisters‚Äù is very emotionally manipulative and I‚Äôm glad chelly and ciera didn‚Äôt buy into it by being mean to the bombshells on her behalf.

However, I also feel bad for huda because her age and lack of relationship experience is showing. This was definitely not the show for her because if she was open and getting to know all the guys people would judge her for leaving her child behind to have a hot girl summer. But if she tries to be closed off in hopes of finding a step father for her child people are going to judge her for not playing the game.

my random e4 thoughts:
- jeremiah saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre handsome üëâüèº‚Äù in the mirror hahahaha. i like him i hope things work out for him but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚¨áÔ∏è
- i like huda but i seriously think this show is not for her, she‚Äôs too insecure and it‚Äôs making her act crazy 
- olandria and taylor are GEMS. such fun people i hope we see more of them. 
- this ‚Äúbaseball‚Äù challenge is seriously disgusting. not in the kissing, just mad sticky. 
- belle-a is growing on me. her personality felt hollow before but i think she was just shy! she‚Äôs the youngest one and i‚Äôm interested to see where this love triangle goes. 
- speaking of belle-a‚Ä¶ that kiss in the evening with nic was INTENSE. nic is playing GAMES. while i think everyone should still be open this early on, he needs to be more clear with both girls that he is equally interested in them both. based on his ‚Äúchat‚Äù (makeout) with cierra, she has no idea how much he‚Äôs feeling belle-a as well! gonna be messy

It is not sisterhood if you're calling a bombshell a bitch and saying you don't like her like wtf it was a fucking challenge. She's a bombshell she came to do and she owes you nothing what she needed to do and sincerely I hope Amaya Jeremiah in the recoupling...

"Ace likes to shake things up more for reactions, than real feelings. The only person Ace seems to have some interest in is Chelle. But he wants to play that lightly for now because if it can go far he doesn‚Äôt want to ruin it by diving in and then hurting her feelings when someone else comes in.

In terms of Huda, I think he kissed her previously out of curiosity and to also play with Jeremiah‚Äôs head to see what he‚Äôs thinking. Because Jeremiah is so pressed on Huda after a short time and was giving closed off energy, I think Ace saw through that and is like this man is being inauthentic. Objectively Ace could probably tell Jeremiah is attractive and a lot of pretty girls will also come in, so why isn‚Äôt he trying to be a little bit open. And then when the question game came out and Huda said she had 2 male partners in a day, Ace was surprised that he didn‚Äôt have any concerns about that. Unfortunately double standards do exist ( even though it‚Äôs a bit gross on both sides) but I think Ace was expecting him to say something like that didn‚Äôt rub him entirely the right way. So he pressed it and started thinking he‚Äôs set on playing safe and he‚Äôs not being real!

After episode 4, Jeremiah basically let it out that he‚Äôs not being authentic either! There was no fault against him for processing the big reveal that Huda is a mother, but not too long after, he was simply like ‚Äúwhen we win‚Äù Like oh reallllly!  He‚Äôs was thinking this is the perfect twist in their script and now if he stays with her they‚Äôll really win. The gameplaying is simply too high with that one!

"I really hate the language being used this season, shit like ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù and whatnot. Not to mention, Huda‚Äôs reaction to one of the guy‚Äôs (i think Austin‚Äôs?) body count was so disappointing lol. When you‚Äôre on a show like love island, I feel like you should be prepared to meet people who‚Äôve gotten around‚Ä¶ without shaming them for it (I do not like Austin at all but that‚Äôs besides the point). Honestly the guys‚Äô reaction to the girls‚Äô stats were disappointing too, but that‚Äôs always been the case tbh.
BelledashA is free to do whatever she wants with her body but I just find it a little silly to be regurgitating purity culture rhetoric. I‚Äôm glad she stepped out of her shell too but I find it shocking that she can‚Äôt see that Nic is thinking w his wiener and will choose the girl that he‚Äôs most likely to bed the soonest. He‚Äôs always been attracted to her, he just didn‚Äôt think he had a proper chance before lol.",42,1749291375.0,dogeatdawgg,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion
"Belle-A‚Äôs adoption of purity culture has made Sierra feel the need to emphasize herself sexually to win Nic over. 

I know I‚Äôm about to get think piece allegations but I doooo need to talk about this. 

Sierra verbalized to the boys earlier in the day that she‚Äôs nervous about Nic‚Äôs perception of the contrast in her and Belle-A‚Äôs numbers of sexual partners. You could hear Sierra hoping Nic isn‚Äôt the type of guy to consider the difference in sexual openness and experience between them. 

However, multiple different times throughout this episode, Nic inadvertently revealed that he is valuing sexual connection and that he is viewing Belle-A as a conquest. Saying Sierra kissing Nic made her 80/40 over Belle-A, but then Belle-A kissing him made her move back up to 50/50, saying he wanted to be the first to kiss her before any other guy in the villa, hitting a fake home run after their make out session, etc etc etc. Regardless of whether Nic is consciously aware of this sentiment or not, we are seeing glimpses of his beliefs through micro interactions. 

Sierra is watching this happen and, in my opinion, reacted the way she did in the evening as a direct result. She learned further into her ‚Äòidentity‚Äô as being more sexually open during her interactions with Nic. Whether she intended it or not, this was an effort to win him over. 

I feel like we are watching in live time how purity culture harms women‚Ä¶both the woman actively engaging in it and the women around them. 

Super hard to watch, esp as the culture at large is moving back to that direction :(",61,1749308087.0,purpleonionlover,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"here‚Äôs what i think/want to happen for sunday‚Äôs recoupling:

- producers give the new bombshells first choice, hannah chooses charlie and amaya chooses jeremiah (possibly for immunity considering they‚Äôve only been here max 2 days)
- taylor goes for olandria (they‚Äôre kind of overlooked as a couple, they‚Äôre both mature and very sweet with each other)
- nic will end up choosing belle-a (he keeps reiterating that she‚Äôs his type and now that she‚Äôs open to getting physical with him his head is definitely turned)
- ace will end up choosing chelley (yes i considered the fact that he might go for huda just to be messy but imo he seems to really have something with chelley with how he keeps reiterating that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs something special‚Äù and also i don‚Äôt want chelley dumped from the island lol)
- austin will go for cierra (seems to like her and also i want cierra to be saved so that a good bombshell can come in for her)
- this leaves huda to get dumped (listen‚Ä¶ she does make good TV but i don‚Äôt want it at the expense of her being so rude to another bombshell over her weird possessiveness for a man she‚Äôs barely known for a week‚Ä¶ lmao)",26,1749313478.0,x_izzy,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion

"My updated ranking: LIKE - Chelley, Ace, Olandria, Taylor, Cierra, Nic // I see the potential - Belle-A // On the Fence but annoyed - Jeremiah, Huda (I‚Äôm split on the order of these 2 but if I‚Äôm being honest she got under my skin a lil more than he did this ep even tho I usually rank her over him) // Honestly don‚Äôt care - Charlie, Austin

TBD on the bombshells but off of first impressions I like Amaya a lil more. Hannah seems sweet she‚Äôs just not my kinda personality.

My Recoupling predictions: Ace/Chelley, Taylor/Olandria, Nic/Belle-A, Jeremiah/Huda, Charlie/Hannah, Austin/Cierra

Dumped: Amaya - I don‚Äôt want her to be gone yet cuz she could be interesting when it comes to Jeremiah & Huda but if the guys are choosing I think Austin might go with Cierra since she chose him in the bases challenge.

"I was super late on watching tonight guys so here‚Äôs everything I would have commented all in one lengthy post from start to finish: 


1. Jeremiah handled it better then expected - but still not great, he was honest abt the fact that for now he still likes her but it could change I guess 

2. Belldasha‚Äôs chat w/ nic at the fire place was really hard to watch imo - she was passive aggressively and awkwardly flirting, although he was ‚Äúflirting‚Äù back his body language was off and his eyes kept darting to get out of the convo 

3. Ciera is such mature and I appreciate her straight forward ness. Felt bad for Nic tho cuz he‚Äôs clearly conflicted - probably currently wishing he wasn‚Äôt so handsome !!üòÇ

  4. Austin actually made me giggle for saying he exposed himself with his very busy sex life lol ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt downvote me

5.Jeremiah‚Äôs teeth are real! He had Invisalign in when Huda came into bed

6. Chelley was great for being honest with Austin, he handled being friendzoned/rejection way better than anticipated 
 
7. Charlie‚Äôs being hard on himself, don‚Äôt worry bby someone‚Äôs coming for u 

8. This game is LITERALLY messy as hell and ACE IS A HORN DOG LOL. Will use any excuse to snog these ladies 

9. NICS FACE WHEN BELLA KISSED CHARLIE KILLED MEEEE - standing there like an NPC LMFAO

10. Huda really needs to relax tbh 

11. HANNAH HAS WAYYYYY TOO MUCH BOTOX HER FACE IS SO PUFFY AND DOESNT MOVE üòü she‚Äôs only 23

12. Chelley is always the voice of reason !!!

13. Who did that to poor Bella‚Äôs lips üò≠ü§£ no wonder she was holding off on a kiss. lol I bet it was Ace 

14. Anytime I watch Love Island I feel FOMO for not being a man. Everything with them is so seriously unserious and I wish being a girl was that lighthearted üò≠üò≠üò≠

15. Did Hannah just say she likes making sex tapes ?!?!? LMFAO GIRL‚Ä¶

16. Amiya is beautiful but her lisp is distracting for me 

17. The way Huda is acting is really not cute, especially when meanwhile Amiya is speaking so eloquently to Ace - and like, she has watched this show before right? lol

18. Belldasha talks much more obnoxiously when flirting and it‚Äôs obviously because she‚Äôs nervous but still can the producers let her know 

19. I‚Äôm really confused what is making Nic change his mind tho so much. Was it really just the kiss with Bella? Cuz him and Ciera seem to have more chemistry. 

20. Olandria is SO funny to me - just her mannerisms and everything killllls me 

21. I feel really bad for Ciera. She seems like such a cool down to earth girl, but she also seems like she gives off a really sexy aura which initially makes guys really attracted to her. Perhaps Nic realizes that he doesn‚Äôt mind Bella‚Äôs boundaries and that once he broke down her walls, he really really likes her . Ugh I feel bad for Ciera cuz I think she‚Äôs gonna get let down and I think she‚Äôs knows. She almost lured Nic to the Photo Booth and was super Handsy to redominate her territory 

22. Also I just added this in last second cuz I realized I had nothing to say abt Taylor - WTF is going on with him and Olandria?? Can they stop playing friendship island pls. Producers need to tell them to stop hanging out with the guys and girls too much 


My guesses on Sunday night :
-Ace couples up with Chelley or Amiya 
-Amiya chats with Austin and Jeremiah
-Charlie and Hannah couple up 
-Some kind of confrontation between Huda/Jeremiah and Amiya 
-Jeremiah reconsiders 
-Nic recouples with Belle-A

I‚Äôm not going to go over every couple. But I‚Äôll highlight certain people and how much I think of them either positively or negatively: 

-Belle-A (positive): I love how she is willing to get out her comfort zone when doing the challenge; now that will definitely make Nic‚Äôs decision very hard in terms of who he re-couples with (arguable the most intriguing love triangle of Nic, Belle-A and Cierra)

-Huda (negative): to an extent, I can understand her worries/concerns regarding the bombshells; but I was taken aback by her demeaning comments about them behind their backs. It‚Äôs giving serial killer yandere vibes; that type of energy I would not touch with a ten foot pole.

"I think people have become delusioned by this show.

So far, I don‚Äôt see much evidence that Jaramiah is just playing the game. It could possibly be true that he really actually likes Hooda.

"Kinda agree until the last part. Belle-A not wanting to be intimate(kissing, sex, etc) is not something she should be ashamed of. I grew up as a non-christian in the Bible Belt so I do get how toxic and ‚Äúdictatorial‚Äù religion can be to a society/an individual. I also agree she shouldn‚Äôt feel bad if she does want to kiss, etc (which is seems like she didn‚Äôt which is good). The bigger concern is WHY she is doing it. If it is to appease a man (which the whole her being excited about 50/50 kinda confirms) then yeah, that‚Äôs sad she‚Äôs sabotaging her values for the wrong reasons but that‚Äôs not ‚Äúpurity culture being bad‚Äù, she is allowed to want to not kiss/have sex relatively soon (though she shouldn‚Äôt be on the show). 

However, I do agree purity culture is responsible for Chelley acting that way (which is sad), Nics interest being a conquest, and also why Belle-A feels the need to push her limits. I just don‚Äôt think she should feel bad for having those values though. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs judging other women for kissing/their body counts or anything either.",2,1749333762.0,reddituser889088,1l59nye,Season 7 - Episode 4 - Post Episode Discussion
