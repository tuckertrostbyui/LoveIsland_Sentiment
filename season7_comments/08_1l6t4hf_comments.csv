I feel like Ace was really strategic with picking Amaya. He knew Austin would obviously pick Chelley again if he picked Amaya.

"I saw someone on tik tok say this episode was rage bait and I fear I have to agree. Everything people are feeling right now is a product of editing and the producers altering the public‚Äôs perception of what‚Äôs actually going on. I‚Äôm sure if they showed us a full clip of Amaya and Ace‚Äôs conversation vs Chelly and Ace‚Äôs we would see that he was actually more interested in Amaya, but the show wanted us to think he was going to pick Chelly so people would be shocked when he didn‚Äôt. The same for Nic and Cierra vs Belledasha. The minute he saw she only had 1 body Nic was never going to choose her because he said she had high standards and he knew he wasn‚Äôt about to meet them. Plus it creates this narrative that he‚Äôs only with Cierra for her body and his head can be easily turned by whoever is willing to sleep with him. With Huda and Jeremiah they are giving her the crazy in love edit with her man getting the love bombing edit because showing them in the shower together on day 4 was intentional. I also saw someone on tik tok say Jeremiah doesn‚Äôt know that the public dislikes him and huda and he‚Äôs afraid of being the villain who dumped a girl just because she‚Äôs a single mom and I fear it‚Äôs true. She put him in between a rock and a hard place by waiting to tell him about the baby because if he leaves her now he looks like the bad guy, so he‚Äôs not going anywhere unless the public votes them out or a bombshell steals him.",45,1749483131.0,BeautyStar07,1l6t4hf,Season 7 - Episode 6 - Post Episode Discussion

"I think we finally saw the real Charlie. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good/interesting thing, but I think his conversation with Hannah this episode was the first time he didn‚Äôt use a rehearsed line.

I like both Olandria and Taylor. I‚Äôm not sure on them together. I do appreciate their recaps and wish to see one every episode.

Ace continues to ride the line between entertaining and annoying chaos gremlin and crossed that line by choosing Amaya. I hope Chelley is done with him so he can cause mayhem without her getting hurt.

Speaking of Chelley, I wonder if she saw the writing on the wall and hedged her bets with Austin. While I think she finds Austin surprisingly endearing, I do think both her and Amaya are playing the game.

Speaking of Austin, I did not have him making one of the sweetest speeches on my bingo card. I‚Äôm starting to believe this man isn‚Äôt malicious but instead extremely malleable. Maybe he‚Äôll grow while in Fiji and away from the Florida manosphere. A girl can dream.

Nic did Belle-A dirty. Cierra is playing this game with Amaya and Chelley and I appreciate her for it.

I don‚Äôt want to project since Cierra hasn‚Äôt said anything about her sexual orientation since joking about kissing the girls, but if she was open it would be a beautiful end narratively if her Chelley couple up for the win.

Also, where was the Belle-A we saw talking to Nic after elimination? That no nonsense woman with her real accent would have been one hell of an islander.

"I had to rewatch and force myself through some of these scenes.. because it was so cringe. 

1. I feel like we‚Äôre not getting the full story with Huda and Jeremiah. They‚Äôre so obsessed with eachother yet I feel like we‚Äôre not seeing the why or how which leads to that 

2. I wish we saw that side of Bell-a sooner, she was obviously very nervous / performing but her goodbye and the speech along with it were real. She ended that so beautifully and I hope to see her succeed, she is truly stunning 

3. Amaya actually grew on me. She annoyed me on the aftersun, and while we didn‚Äôt see it I have a hunch that she possibly had a side convo with Huda that wasn‚Äôt shown. She seems like she knows the game well enough to play it right, buuut I don‚Äôt think she will stick with ace. 

4. I can‚Äôt wait to see the crash out Cierra has. Nic kinda has it coming for him. 

5. Charlie and Hannah are my unexpected favorites, out of all of them their connection seems the most natural. 

6. Olandria and Taylor have a few sweet moments that are briefly shown, and while it‚Äôs only been a week I either see them stepping it up or a new bombshell stepping in for her. 

7. Ace and Amaya just don‚Äôt make sense to me.. unless there was more that didnt make the Final Cut. Ace is playing the game, Amaya seemed to vibe better with Austin, but I‚Äôm glad Austin saved Chelley. Chelleys person hasn‚Äôt popped in yet but I know her bombshell is coming 

8. If editing is telling the truth, Austin really was disappointed Ace took Amaya. If their morning meditations continue, Ace is in for his own love triangle

I have come to the conclusion that Austin is one of those weird racist sorta guys that actually like black women even though he has the views he has he sees them as separate because he has had many many chances to leave her and he has unfortunately stuck around although he did make sure Chelley stayed in the villa which I do appreciate,29,1749444814.0,Chemical-Froyo-6286,1l6t4hf,Season 7 - Episode 6 - Post Episode Discussion

"Running here to share my thoughts with y‚Äôall. 

1. Idc for Huda and Jeremiah. They‚Äôre not cute or goals, they‚Äôre so manipulative to each other and Huda is also manipulative to the girls. She weaponizes sisterhood. How she treated Cierra and Amaya is how she will treat any new girl who comes in tbh.

2. Belledasha had a good run buuuttt it was her time. She couldn‚Äôt land Nic and the other boys were already locked in for this group. People are saying bring her back but I say she should leave on the high note. 

3. Piggy backing off #2- Nic isn‚Äôt a villain. Maybe sloppy with how he kissed them both within such short time but I think he‚Äôs acting very love island (as he should) for it to be only week 1 lol. He‚Äôs cute and he never forced either girl to continue liking him. 

4. Olandria is a dream, beautiful and wise, Taylor doesn‚Äôt deserve her. He‚Äôs very like lukewarm with her? Distant with 0 affection so I‚Äôm over him lol. He‚Äôs a boy, Olandria needs a man.

5. To wrap this up- Love Hannah and Charlie, happy for them! The square between Chelley, Austin, Amaya, and Ace is a mess I feel. Not really feeling Ace for Chelley, idk if I ever was, but him not choosing her kind of solidified it. He‚Äôs charming but hopefully she moves on.",35,1749449890.0,Fantastic_Square_486,1l6t4hf,Season 7 - Episode 6 - Post Episode Discussion

I think Chelley was really smart to go back to Austin - eww - because I think deep down, she knew that Ace was going to bring her down. 

 Nic was so terribly wrong for what he did to Belle-A. She was not one of my favorites but the way she trusted him and for him to turn his back on her after saying all of those things to her?

"Thoughts:

- I thought that recoupling came too soon after bombshells showed up. They didn‚Äôt even get a date?

- Bummed that we don‚Äôt get to watch Bell-a‚Äôs character development. She was opening up and surprising us all. When she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my loss‚Äù‚ÄîOKAY GIRLIE!

- Loved when Ace said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been 4 days‚Äù to Huda‚Ä¶ but then he ruined it when he chose Amaya over Chelly. Man better not talk about string theory again.

- Chelly deserves more than Austin, but glad she was chosen by him. Sometimes gotta use him, abuse him, lose him. 

- maybe unpopular opinion, but I don‚Äôt think Nic is hot? I hated that he talked about how special the photobooth moment was in his speech, but had just told the boys that Cierra ‚Äúmounted‚Äù him. So gross, but I agreed with his pick. Cierra and him have more chemistry together. Cierra is sweet and deserves better.

- Glad Huda calmed down and apologized to Amaya, but wished she said clearly what she was apologizing for. I hate watching women being petty over a boy... 

- Charlie and Hannah are cute.

- Amaya seems nice for being chill with Huda/Jeremiah. She‚Äôs very pretty, but I do cringe a little when she laughs though.

Nic made the right choice. Bell-A seems a simply lovely human. But it feels as though she was too naive and inexperienced (in the best of ways) to thrive here.

"my initial thoughts on the recoupling:

Belle-a: as¬†sad as i am to see her go, i feel like it played out in the best possible way. ¬†she‚Äôs¬†a really sweet girl, but i honestly don‚Äôt think this was the show for her. after this i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll have any trouble finding a nice christian man back home.¬†

Cierra: Cierra on the other hand seems to have the extroverted personality to really strive on a show like this. she seems to be genuinely confident and unafraid of confrontation, so i‚Äôm excited to see what plays out with Nic in the next episode.¬†

Huda & Jerimiah: yawn. we know what to expect from them at this point. (but is it just me or was Jerimiah giving a litttllle bit disinterested this episode‚Ä¶idk)

-yes we hate to see Bella go bc she actually has standards but Nic was never the right type for her. She needed a man who was probably older, more mature and ok with her speed of things.  The conversation Nic had with Cierra actually flowed and you could tell there was chemistry from the start. Yes Cierra started moving from an insecure place at times, but she‚Äôs young. Nic was more attracted to Bella‚Äôs beauty and the opportunity to kiss her but they didn‚Äôt have easy conversations

- [ ] 1.	‚Å†Sooooo mad  Ace picked Amaya! She is a beautiful girl but Ace and Chelle had so much chemistry and he was busy playing a game in his head. I don‚Äôt think he wants to lock it in when Chelle until later because he doesn‚Äôt want to be closed off yet and can see that with her. But, all that playing gave me the ick and I hope Chelle gets a fine new man coming in and about her who will also make Ace sick
- [ ] 2.	‚Å†That shower scene! Momma is fast!!! But you could tell they were messing in bed already. But still at least there were covers there.
- [ ] 3.	‚Å†Nic did tell Bella he was 50/50 so you can‚Äôt be too played when someone tells you that. And Cierra new he was going back and forth.

And what's bullshit is that Nick literally told the boys that Cierra mounted him like she forced him to kiss her then brought it up in the speech as some special moment.

"Episode was a lil dull - I was skipping a few scenes but finally a recoupling/dumping!

Nic shocked me, I think he made the right choice cuz he and Cierra have more in common but I thought Belle-A had turned his head enough by making out with him. Sad to see her go, she was just blossoming!

I was initially annoyed with Ace choosing Amaya BUT it does feel obvious he sees Chelley as the endgame but isn‚Äôt done exploring yet. He doesn‚Äôt want to lock in already and be another Huda/Jeremiah situation that he‚Äôs been so actively criticizing. He and Chelley were talking about their timing not lining up and in his confessional he was saying Amaya has been clear about liking him but having to work a lil more for Chelley even tho they have chemistry, so he went with the easy (non-derogatory) option for now. And like Chelley said on After Sun he‚Äôs a game player lol he‚Äôs thinking long term storyline. I just don‚Äôt know if Chelley is gonna wait around until he‚Äôs ready nor should she if her person (obviously not Austin) comes in.

"I wonder if production had two separate plans for tonight based on who Nic decided to pick.

But when they filmed the fire pit scenes Ari said the girl not picked would be ‚Äúimmediately dumped.‚Äù

I assume the islanders have to confirm who they are coupling with w/ production before they film the scene, right? So I guess it switched to dumping after they realized Belledasha was on the chopping block.

If true it‚Äôs interesting to note that production soured on an OG so fast. I wonder if it‚Äôs because of her aversion to kissing?",0,1749436592.0,eurydicey,1l6t4hf,Season 7 - Episode 6 - Post Episode Discussion

I never claimed that! Maybe re read the thread angry boy. I made an educated guess based on experiences with men like nic. I never claimed definitives about all men or even nic! Hence the words like ‚Äúmay‚Äù and ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúplayed a role.‚Äù  You were the only one to definitively say you KNOW why nic acted the way he did. So chillax And so some self reflection.
