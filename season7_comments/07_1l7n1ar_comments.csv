Austin highkey clocked Ace's tea. Ace wants to be chased by Chelley and she's not gonna let that happen. The sooner he realizes it the better. Because why would you pick Amaya knowing damn well you don't even like her like that talking about I want to move slow but you were kissing Chelleys forhead the other day.

Ace has absolutely ZERO interest in Amaya and instead of telling her that he’s decided to try and make her seem like the problem. He’s nitpicking her behavior in a way that’s so manipulative and gaslighting and I honestly don’t believe these are his predetermined boundaries when he neverrrrrr brought them up to anyone else and then started talking about them as soon as he coupled up with Amaya. “What do you call your partner” he set her up for that 100%. He said don’t TOUCH me don’t LOOK at me don’t BREATHE in my direction and then tried to make out like it was her bad???

While I do agree that Huda and Jeremiah may not be legit (or at least be a lasting couple), it’s very obvious to me now that he is projecting his own ideas of love on other people. 

The way he did Amaya was so wrong. He clearly changed his mind as soon as he picked her cuz he heard what Austin said about Chelley and realized she was gonna be gone. I almost feel like his advice to Taylor about Olandria not waiting forever on him was advice he should have taken himself. 
She came up to him and apologized for being a bit reactionary, (although I would’ve too, it was confusing) and then he immediately roped her into a trick question. He’s not laying down boundaries - he was clearly self sabotaging cuz he wants Chelley instead. 

And then to pull Chelley for a chat and basically still try to string her along and play cat and mouse? Wtf.

Then sucks her down in a photo booth bc she basically said she’s gonna leave their couple. Weirdo.

Ace is evil and miserable. Weaponizing “slow burn” I did not want him for Chelley and I’m glad bc the way he did Amaya was not okay. She did nothing wrong but be herself! She’s too much a baddie to be knocked down just for speaking and breathing. Weirdo.

Also, not a fan of Huda ever but isn’t crazy that her “real man” is literally refusing to close it off with her? Their date was lackluster af then saying it’s too “early” to close.

"Ace and Amiah are not a good match. She was a much better match with Austin. This proved to be true especially after the scene with Austin crashing out about Ace's intentions with Chelley. Austin and Amaya have matching energy. 

Ace probably won't commit to Chelley or any one girl in the villa at this rate.

Taylor acting so scatterbrained and Olandria is much more grounded than him. I don't see that connection lasting.

Nic is slimy and Cierra is letting him off easy. He will be susceptible to fooling around in casa amor.

Charlie and Hannah are love birds, producers barely bothered showing them because there's no drama there.

Huda and Jeramiah are toxic. Notice how Olandria sees it as Jeramiah love bombing Huda based on what she's heard from Huda. In reality Huda is love bombing him and testing his ass over and over again, lucky for her, his fake ass only cares about winning, I doubt he will slip up. Not because he likes her but because he's playing the game.

At this point tho, neither of them should pair up with Ace. I’m also starting to believe that just like Belldasha, the love he is looking for is not on this island. It’s one thing to be a slow burner, but it’s another thing to constantly cut people off at the smallest thing or wait for people to chase you. 
He thinks he is THE catch and no lady is good enough for him - which is why he’s never told any woman he loves them.

"I have no one in real life to rant to about this, so I made an account just so I can do it here. Ace fucked up so bad he made me agree with Austine cus wtf is this cat and mouse chase youre trying to achieve with chelley? If you want her so bad, why tf didn't u choose her in the recoupling instead of choosing Amaya? Talking bout ""did I make the wrong choice"" like choosing her and keeping her in the villa suddenly allows you to act that way with her. i never really cared for Amaya but him trying to paint her as crazy got me all types of fucked up. You wanna set boundaries? Cool, but do these boundaries only exist for Amaya cus we never heard of them till he got coupled up with her. The girl never even had the chance to touch you or act romantic with you because you immediately shut her out, mind you, RIGHT after the recoupling, so wtf are you complaining about? She clearly said ""babe"" is a part of her lingo, so what's so hard to understand? Making her seem crazy for wanting to act like she's in a couple (WHICH SHE IS) just because you don't like her, SO WHY CHOOSE HER? Don't get me started on Taylor hes with a barbie, a queen if you will, mature beautiful funny and HOT AF, and this guy is saying he's not physically attracted??? like ik he ain't talking Rambo lookin ah, hogging the covers all for himself while Nic is making out and sticking his tongue down another girls throat thinking Cierra wont find out. This season's men are so trashy that they need to be put in their place. Honestly? kick them all out and get new ones. They put these beautiful women in the trenches with rats. Huda and jeremiah piss me tf off that it's not even worth commenting about, and I've gotta admit some of these girls they're getting speak so weird like they haven't socialized with humans in a minute. Amaya and Hannah speak like they're reading from a script but so poorly you'd think its a porno and belldasha was a sweet girl but every sentence I heard from her I read before in a tiktok comment section. The rest of the girls speak and act okay, but Huda needs a quick reality check because that ain't your husband! Anyways, my babies Chelley, Olandria, and Cierra need some real men and SOON.",51,1749583200.0,alloopsienodaisy,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
"There is something so sinister about ace and trust me I wanted so bad to love the guy but i feel like there is a deep hatred for women lying inside of him. He feels some type of superiority over Amaya because he picked her, but it feels like he also intentionally did not choose Chelley so he could have some power there as well. Him immediately nitpicking Amaya for this babe thing which is clearly not said romantically but is just part of her regular vocabulary is giving misogynist im sorry.",66,1749522529.0,freckledcornflake,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

This season is truly I think a total miss with casting. When you cast people that want to be influencers or are already influencers they’re going to come in with an agenda and self produced. People that have normal jobs and don’t care as much about social media don’t give a fuck about what the public thinks. Or maybe i’m just in my late 20s and don’t relate at all to these people anymore.,23,1749521130.0,haley520,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"The more I think about it the worse I feel for Amaya! He really did immediately burst her bubble and she’s naturally so giddy! Plus I know if she’s coming after Chelley with misplaced anger and that doesn’t get resolved quickly it’s gon be rough for her especially online cuz Chelley’s loved. She won’t see that part immediately but I’m sure she will at some point. So I’m hoping it’s just not as bad as the preview made it seem and/or it’s resolved rather quickly!

I do actually believe Ace on the physical boundaries but boy did he do a HORRIBLE job of conveying this all! But based on how he’s been moving in the villa outside of challenges I am inclined to think it was at least partially the truth. Some people are just natural flirts but don’t take things further than that with everyone. Other than the Chelley forehead kiss I can’t recall much physical interaction from him with anyone and he’d already known her before the show. And I feel like most of the chats he has even with Chelley he’s seperated from whoever it is with his arms/legs crossed. Plus he mentioned night 1 he usually doesn’t kiss on the first date and I remember Yulissa commenting he didn’t try to touch or cuddle her at night - granted he didn’t actually pick Yulissa.

But the fact that I believe him makes it kinda worse cuz he’s been moving that way with his boundaries already but still managed to be kind and charming. But with Amaya here it was just really cold delivery. And I’m sure she felt the switch. Maybe not so much the first convo, cuz I saw someone say on Twitter he might’ve just been really trying to reassure her that he was still interested even if he isn’t physical with her to prevent her from second guessing it later. I could see that but again he did so TERRIBLY. It was at best very direct and not the Ace we’d been seeing and like she said it was bad timing. And it only got worse as the episode went on, it really got cold and kinda manipulative by the 3rd or 4th rehash of the convo. It felt like once he realized how easy it was to get a reaction he just kept going at her, the “babe” discussions really did feel like a bridge too far. Especially how he got her to admit it - cuz she obviously felt like “oh we’re moving on” into a better conversation and it turned into more rules. Sure have your boundaries but be able to compromise a little too. I still don’t hate him like some do but he’s gone down my list for sure!",15,1749559059.0,One_Caramel7003,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
Ace is literally so emotional unavailable because what do you mean you picked Amaya and say ur so excited to share a bed with her but now your being distant.. I’m all for boundaries but the way he brought it up seemed like he baited her into saying babe so that he could use that against her and place that boundary. He could have had the conversation without making Amaya feel like the villain for using “babe” to refer to people because she obviously doesn’t do it on purpose..,16,1749568046.0,https-kez,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

Ace is not a good person. Setting boundaries is not the same as trying to change a woman that you clearly don’t like. We were all so confused by Ace choosing Amaya because he obviously didn’t like her last episode. Picking her to be messy and then trying to make her the bad guy in the situation is so disgusting.

"I think Chelly knows the game Ace is playing (see her aftersun comments) so she’s keeping Ace as an option but wont lock in until he makes the first move. Shes a smart player keeping her options open while not revealing too much about where she stands. Hence why she was able to flip back to Austin when Ace didn’t pick her.

On the other hand I feel so bad for Amaya because (putting on my survivor cap) her love island social game is not good. She’s a beautiful sweet girl and I bet irl guys just fall to her feet. She has no clue how to deal with the type of psychological warfare that’s going on that villa. Ace is cruelly using her as a pawn in his own narrative. And she fucked up by showing him she was upset with him. It endeared her to me, because I love dissecting the meta narrative and I always appreciate the islanders that play with their heart on their sleeve - but I’m in a small minority. Most of the audience just wants to see a good love story.

The more calculating move for Amaya would have been to take note, keep it cute and wait for a bombshell. Or ideally going for Jeremiah though I understand why she didn’t bc 1) she has no clue how much Huda is disliked by the audience 2) Huda would have made her life hell in there.",38,1749532273.0,Saltybitc,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"I’m officially putting every man in the villa on notice. The bar is so low I need to look up to see hell.

Ace is acting like someone who listens to podcasts. “I said all that so she would like me more” is one of the most red flag comments I’ve ever heard on this show. I’m not finding anything he does funny anymore. He can take his script and manosphere beliefs and get the hell out of the villa. 

I will give Nic a sliver of grace because Ace was very careful in how he talked about his conversations with Amaya but he’s on thin ice. I’ve never seen man babies this worked up over a woman using “babe.”

It’s okay that Taylor isn’t physically attracted to Olandria. I don’t understand *why* because she’s smart, stunning, and carrying the season with Chelley when it comes to quips, but it’s okay. What’s isn’t okay is openly talking about that with Ace and then forcing himself to be physical with her. You can’t force attraction. I like him but he shouldn’t lead her on.

Jeremiah wanted to play the game and be in a steady couple early but I think he bit off more than he can chew. Huda is already talking about them moving in together. If they really are at that point then leave together now. If they’re not then he needs to pull on the breaks while he still can. It’s both the right thing to do morally and the right thing strategically. Once a couple reaches a certain point the viewers will no longer accept you ending things or moving at Casa. Right now it’s giving a fourth place finish at most.

Charlie was fine this episode but don’t think I didn’t notice that he was only activated when the blonde entered the villa. That’s not necessarily bad. I’m clocking it anyway.

The boy who came out the best this episode was Austin. *Austin.* His friendship with Chelley seems real and I like how he has her back.

"This episode was boring. Nothing changed and everyone was predictable. 

Huda and Jeremiah predictably moved too fast. He love bombed her and she keeps fast tracking their relationship. Whatever at this point. I’m over seeing them. 

Taylor did nothing even though there’s a 10/10 giving him all her attention. Boring, moving on, get Olandria someone else. 

Austin complaining about a love triangle when he wasn’t even in the running yesterday and he’s separately made out with Amaya. Spare me red pilled men’s dramatics. 

Cierra’s putting so much work into Nic for no reward. Honestly I fail to see the big deal about him. He just thinks with his dick.

Amaya and Ace are aggressively miscommunicating. Ace making it out to be that Amaya is the psycho one for expecting at least some romance from the person who just chose her to be coupled up with is crazy.  That being said it’s not helpful for a communication that she starts cursing or crying when it gets halfway through a conversation and talks over everyone she’s talking to. 

Ace is your average 22 year old guy who’s never been in a relationship. He has no idea how to form an actual bond with a woman and assumes he’s the prize. Austin was right about one thing and one thing only. Chelly is never going to chase Ace. She’s not that kind of woman. If he wanted her then he should’ve chosen her. Instead he’s ruined his chances with both women who had him as their #1 in less than 24 hours.

We saw nothing of Charlie and Hannah and yet they are still the best liked couple, simply bc everyone else sucks!

Olandria is a gorgeous and genuine and funny girl, but that doesn’t mean Taylor has to like her romantically bc of that. If they aren’t compatible they aren’t compatible: idk I feel like it’s overblown when even olandria will 1000% most likely jump ship if a better bombshell walks through the door no questions asked. Ion even think she like Taylor all that much, besides the initial southern boy charm. She is def waiting it out just like he is.

"Okay listen, at the cost of sounding like a complete NUT...just hear me out...

There have been rumors floating around that Chelley and Ace are playing the game and that they came in with a plan to pretend to explore other connections but ultimately chose each other, essentially crafting a love story to win the prize.

I didn't believe it one bit... until this episode. 

Both Chelley and Ace have friendzoned the person they are partnered with, with Chelley doing it convincingly while Ace just looked insane this episode trying to do the same thing. It explains why Ace hates Jeremiah, he sees him also playing the game and wants the attention on Jeremiah for doing so. What's the saying.. that if someone is always accusing you of cheating, they're probably the ones cheating?? Same type of shit. 

And now we see Chelley and Amaya fighting next episode. I'm guessing it's just real, raw feelings coming from Amaya, and Chelley getting defensive because she doesn't want her plan to be revealed or touched upon. 

I'm calling it now...they choose each other in the end, with the narrative of ""we just kept coming back together"" 😬😬 Production didn't know Yulissa was throwing around slurs until the fan base pointed it out BEFORE THE SHOW EVEN AIRED, they clearly don't vet their cast.

"My rankings based on who I like the most as couples:
1. Charlie and Hannah (the fact that they’re number one for me this fast is telling about the cast)
2. Cierra and Nic (she’s too smart for him but I think they’re cute)
3. Austin and Chelley (Always loved Chelly but tonight’s episode made me like Austin even more, particularly his chat with Charlie on the balcony)
4. Olandria and Taylor (Taylor is the reason they are ranked so low… ola is a catch and a great communicator)
5. Huda and Jeremiah (it’s giving fake…. It’s giving “I’m here to win the money)
6. Amaya and Ace (absolutely 100% not compatable)

My rankings of people based on how entertaining they will be:
1. Cierra (I think she’s super likable and hope that she flips for a bombshell)
2. Ace (messy, like totally get bad vibes, but that shit does entertain me ngl)
3. Jeremiah (I wanna see him get his head turned in casa, like I want him to slip up and his whole “act” be outed)
4. Amaya (the emotion, the drama, I am Amaya)
5. Olandria (calls it how she sees it… which aligns with how I see it)
6. Austin (goofy)
7. Huda (messy and is gonna crash out in casa)
8. Nic (just seems lost, like not a whole lot going up there and I feel like he was absolutely drained from his first love triangle and will not turn his head again bc he can’t handle it)
9. Chelley (nothing bad to say, but also she’s not giving much in terms of drama and entertainment: no mess, no love)
10. Charlie (the accent is moving him up higher in the rankings than what I think he brings to the table)
11. Hannah (cute I guess)

"y'all I was SCREEEAMING!!! im gonna write my thoughts before reading so you all don't sway my opinions...

Huda was so sweet in how she was supporting Amaya. Her and Jeremiah grew on me during the waterpark date. 

Nick and Cierra while I thought that was going to be the biggest drama, ended up being how like real life conflicts are resolved lol. its super hard to be stern with your partner sometimes when you know they had good intentions in their mistakes. 

Olandria and Taylor ... are trying to make it work but honestly Olandria needs someone a bit more forward and I'd be fine if Taylor left. I like him but you have to be stupid if you aren't physically attracted to Olandria. 

Austin and Chelley ... were GROWING ON ME??????? I cant believe it .... it was kinda cute how Austin was getting annoyed with Ace and her talking again and how he hated being in a triangle!!!

Charlie and Hannah, meh they're cute but boring for now. 

ACE AND AMAYA. HOLYYYY INCOMPATIBLE!!!! they both have the worst intentions when talking to each other and are definitely fighting EACH OTHER rather than the issue. Ace should be more mindful of time appropriateness for conversations and Amaya should be a bit more patient before getting offended. They definitely are not going to last long and I think they're gonna cause drama for everyone!!!

I just think his approach was a little… odd? Out of ""character""? Amaya’s reaction was definitely over the top during the first conversation, but imagine a guy picking you at a recoupling talking about how he’s excited to share a bed, but then minutes after you get sat down and lectured about how he’s going to continue exploring and you can’t do anything that can be read as “affectionate.” And to add insult to injury, she literally had a better connection with Austin, so she’s probably (understandably) a little miffed Ace chose her only to do all this when Ace wasn’t her first choice.

He also hasn’t really been this cold with Chelley and the other girls. Before we saw him get excited by the prospect of kissing and groping other girls, being open and encouraging the guys to stay open also, and even giving Chelley a very “affectionate” forehead kiss. Maybe Chelley is a special exception because they have history outside of the Villa, but I don’t know; this just did not feel like the Ace we’ve been seeing the past few episodes. It feels like he’s nitpicking Amaya specifically (especially with the “babe” stuff), and it’s crazy because he literally didn’t have to pick her; no one expected him to, and she wasn't his strongest connection; Chelley was.",33,1749521568.0,kimmiecla,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"This episode left me sooo uneasy! I wish Huda and Jeremiah had a private conversation about the closed off thing. Makes me skeptical how he talks about living with Huda but want to stay open with her…

Cierra forgave nic so quick. But I hope he doesn’t make the same mistake withholding info from her.

Austin?!! Lmao he was pissed and I don’t blame him honestly bc Ace keeps his cards to himself and is not being clear with what he wants…and it just so happens to be with women Austin are into. I swear I would like him even more if it wasn’t for his support of 45th. 

I’m sorry but I’m still side eyeing Taylor, he just doesn’t seem all into Olandria. They cute but the chemistry on his part felt force. I just hopeeeee he’s not playing her. But I also hope someone comes along and swoops her up!

Ace convo with Chelley was weird bc she doesn’t have to change who she is to fit your criteria, you either like her or you don’t. I fear Austin clicks better with her😬 ace and Chelley just look better together ngl. 

Ace and Amaya aren’t compatible at all and truthfully I don’t think he even knows what he wants fr. I get his boundaries for sure and honestly don’t have a problem with it. But he’s trying to play it too cool for me. I just don’t think they are hearing each other fr and I don’t think Ace even likes Amaya past the physical.

"Thoughts on the episode
- girl Charlie’s with is annoying asff sorry
- Jeremiah is DEFINITELY love bombing… his 😬 face after she was talking about nic, and  I haven’t even seen them talk about anything deep …. 
- damn ace can’t even give the girl a hug while she’s crying? 🫠 if he wasn’t feeling her he should’ve picked chelley bc he’s talking about “hes not affectionate until he’s feeling someone” and he’s over here kissing chelleys head like cmon he had a chance to couple up w her and now he’s hurting someone else bc he’s tryna be a player .. like idk he moves SO weird to me 😭
- unpopular opinion: i love Cierra and don’t mind Austin.. for now
- Lmao @ Ace sleeping with his arms crossed he really should’ve picked chelley 
- ARE JEREMIAH AND HUDA…..
- Olandria and Taylor :( we need a new bombshell for both of them especially Olandria she deserves someone who’s all about her!!! 
- Did they make a waterpark or was that there ? …
- I wish they all had more chemistry … not even comparing it to last season but in general like I barely see any friendship chats between guys and girls  even olandria just said she doesn’t talk to Jeremiah one on one like girl yall have lived together for a week how do they not all talk ? 
- Amaya also deserves someone who’s all about her. I feel like “babe” is such an innocent term especially if you call everyone that.. maybe it’s bc I call everyone babe 🤷🏼‍♀️I understand his boundaries but damn can a girl breathe
- Jeremiah is a player girl RUN he’s so “down for her” yet doesn’t wanna be closed off … boy byeee
- That big ass cowboy hat…
- mini walton goggins needs to get his shit together bc Cierra is a dime & a bombshell is gonna try and snatch her up so quick 
- no bc Amaya really didn’t even like come on to Ace at all how is she “focused on being boo’d up so quick” ?????? idk I need bombshells now these guys are irritating me fr especially Ace bro.

I feel like he honestly just needed the green light from her to really start making changes and
Showing that he reciprocates everything she’s doing and it shows in this episode. Plus remembering last season a lot of couples to me didn’t have chemistry much until around casa or a little bit before casa maybe even after.

Austin clocking Ace was not on my bingo card, but Chelley doesn’t chase! 

I thought the date was a fun jdea! I think Huda definitely is all in with Jeremiah and I think Jeremiah likes her but I also think her being a parent is circulating in his brain! Honestly I don’t even know if he fully can comprehend it in this environment!! I definitely think in casa he will switch and Huda about to crash out!! 

Olandria is to good for Taylor and he doesn’t want her! I feel like he is forcing it! 

Amaya girl if I got picked and they had a few of those conversations I’d be confused to! 

I think Cierra will be over nic fast 

They need more men asap!! Also please have a line up of good men for casa cause ima need all of them to recouple. Current men in the house ain’t it!

"Episode left me with thoughts mainly about Ace and Taylor

With Ace I am kind of surprised he wants to move so slow that it is basically prudish. I applaud him setting boundaries and not thinking with his dick. I don't expect it to be respected much online because men are expected to want to jump on anything they like and are looked at funny for not doing it. I think he is wasting his time by not going full throttle for Chelly though. He actually looks different talking to her compared to the other women.

With Taylor I feel like he might have been a late bloomer and doesn't know how to get where he wants to be with Olandria. A lot of tall lanky guys were a gaggly mess of arms and legs coming up, so it can be hard to find a date until they fill out a bit and come into their own. He might only have 3 or so real years of dating experience and now is in the villa trying to make it work. Figuring that out on tv is going to be rough because Ola's fans aren't going to show him any grace.

\*edit\*

My other thought was Huda was manipulative as hell. Basically trying to put Jeremiah in a box to close things off and holding back affection as a clear sign of displeasure at him not doing it.

The way she reacted was really inappropriate, and I think he was right in that second conversation when he pointed out that she doesn’t let people talk before immediately jumping in to be defensive (as seen on the preview for next episode).

I know the girls hate to see it but Ace communicated his boundaries like a grown man. He said hes uncomfortable being called babe and being super cuddly early and Amaya wasn't understanding him at all and just blew up over it. Be reasonable here; the only thing he did wrong was he could've waited for that first conversation.

I can respect Ace having boundaries.  Same way I’d respect any man or woman establishing those same boundaries (belledasha this season).  But none of it adds up.  He seems like a misogynist at heart.

Chelley is too good for him.

Damn Amaya my fellow Dominican you should’ve moved on after he was setting up his boundary after the recouple.  He went from saying all that nice sounding shit to telling you essentially “don’t touch me”😭😭",5,1749521438.0,DisgracedSolitude,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"Unpopular opinion - but I really don’t think Ace meant for his delivery to be received how it was! I think he really enjoys getting to know people through conversation and doesn’t want to be distracted by other things that can make you think your baseline feelings of someone are stronger than what they are. I think organically he would do those things if he actually likes someone. He probably thought it was best to establish boundaries from the beginning before there’s any confusion and then they can just continue to vibe and talk. 

I won’t give him an entire pass because I do think he was game playing when he chose Amaya bc he wasn’t ready to couple up with Chelle and really see what things could be. So because of that he was also hoping to dip in both areas and talk to them both without crossing the line by kissing and cuddling with one of them.  

But I get how Amaya felt like so you chose me to be a basic friend? But I also feel like she didn’t take time to actually hear him. 

It’s also interesting how everyone applauses Bella’s boundaries but Ace can’t have any. He hasn’t been touchy with anyone yet, at least outside of challenges",9,1749563521.0,TheGoodVybz,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"Crazy how everyone thinks this cast is more immature than last season when I think they're having way more mature discussions. Like the way Cierra handled Nick?  Very rational. And it was the same advice Chelley gave her to talk it out in the morning and give him another chance. 


Also I know everyone thinks Ace is evil, but what has he said that's so wrong?  Every analysis he makes about the others IS correct. He called out the lovebombing early. He called out Huda's psycho possessiveness early. He told Taylor not to be a bum when Olandria is an 11/10. 


I understand that this episode did not favor him bc he got defensive w Amaya and honestly, did not need to pull her for that last chat. It's clear he wants Chelley but doesn't wanna lock in too fast bc that makes him uncomfortable. So he was wrong for that. But the way everyone thinks he's some sinister fuckboy is crazy. He hasn't done anything fuckboy like. He didn't literally makeout w two girls outside of a challenge in one day. That's Nick. Like bsffr rn. You can hate his delivery on the things he says, but you can't disagree bc they're all true. 


And if you're not entertained by the fact that he -and a lot of the cast, quite


 frankly- don't want to rush into shallow relationships, then just say that. But don't call them evil bc they're not immediately trying to boo up your favorite contestant. ",0,1749528113.0,Miserable-Acadia7272,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"I get both sides when it comes to Ace & Amaya!

From her side they did JUST couple up and he’s immediately coming at her saying he’s still open and telling her new boundaries and restrictions on what she can and can’t do every conversation. Especially with something like “babe” which is a normal part of her vocabulary. I was with him in the first convo but it did start to feel like he was trying to poke at her later when he saw how easy an emotional reaction was to get. It started to feel like gaslighting by the end. It’s easy for her to feel like WHY did you pick me if you have such a hard line with me. *I didn’t think it last night but now it does make me wonder if production was in his ear at all to pick Amaya cuz the way he seemingly immediately went to shut her expectations down is crazy - record time crash & burn from these 2*

From his side it does feel like she keeps only focusing on him saying they’re still open/exploring rather than the boundaries he’s saying within their own relationship (physicality, language etc). Even tho he’s a flirt I do actually believe him when he says he likes to take it slow physically - in episode 1 he mentioned not usually kissing on the first date. There are some people who just like to flirt but won’t necessarily take things to the next level with everyone. And we haven’t actually seen him do much physically outside of challenges, other than the forehead kiss to Chelley, who he came in knowing.

not saying ace isn't playing the game, he def is, but i find his honestly so refreshing. amaya came off mad immature in comparison.",-20,1749521866.0,Ambitious_Step5797,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

I understand for Amaya it was hard to hear, but I feel like her reaction was extreme. I dont think someone setting a boundary about not wanting to rush into things is unreasonable.

"Ace took a new angle.  LOL.  Not I'm not touching you. I mean, if I respect it when one of the women puts up her boundaries...  I do think his speech should have come before choosing though.  Amaya crying over him is craziness, after a damn day.  I think Ace's ""rules"" will be a losing strategy.  

Austin and Chelley are wasting my time with their dryness.  They're trying to force a circle into a square. 

Ace's advice to Taylor was dead on.  I love me some Olandria, but I think some game playing is happening.  Ain't no way. Two more circles trying to fit into squares. He looked like he was just scolded by his mom, when he went to her at the end.

Amaya is WAY too over the top with Ace.  It's too soon for all that energy.  Girl, walk away.   Get them off my screen.  Austin being upset about Ace/Chelley is fake af.  Go find Amaya and hush.  Chelley handled Ace PERFECTLY! ""I'm gonna be me, if we click, we click.""  That's the only mindset.  He's feeling himself a bit too much. 

WHY are people acting like communication with others stops 7 days into the show?  I can't!  Amaya & Chelley tonight?  Lorrrrrrd... Amaya is giving actor vibes to me.  Too much, way too soon.",-10,1749538353.0,Tanmb11,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"but he picked her and said he was excited to share a bed and with how much amaya says babe i am sure she said it before he picked her too. suddenly switching up by laying down rules, trapping her into saying babe was what she called a partner (when the main answer was a custom petname and babe just an admission like oh yeah ofc, with the unspoken part being that she also uses that casually) is not boundary setting. especially when he saw in the convo as she tried to agree it slipped out a few times it's clear it's like punctuation to her but she still was like ok, i will do that, and he still calls her passive-aggressive and acts like he cant possibly understand it's something she says a lot without romantic intention or possessive meaning, and even as she accidentally says it while trying to do what he's asking he takes it as a huge slight. to me that's controlling 

eta: (andanothathing!) also just unpleasant and ultimately coming across deceitful because how do you sit there stone faced and as you watch her struggle with her words or as she tries to be lighthearted? he clearly has no intention of understanding or connecting with her, if he did he can also laugh it off or do anything to make it not uncomfortable. the fact he's saying one thing 'i still am interested in you' while every cue he's giving verbally, through body language and through how he's staring her down while adamantly not picking up what she;s communicating and making her restate her clear meaning over and over again screams that he has no intention of connecting with her",11,1749587249.0,shgrdrbr,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
"""he express his boundaries calmly"" is not entirely an accurate way to convey how he was actually expressing his ""boundaries"" very COLDLY. it wasn't like he told her these boundaries with a smile and then a hug at the end, a reminder that he was excited to get to know her.

no, he sat Amaya down RIGHT after the recoupling ceremony to basically berate her about what she should and shouldn't expect, and then he went around to the boys and misrepresented what Amaya had actually said, re: the ""babe"" convo. he did it to make her look obsessive/crazy when i think he fully knows she's saying it casually.

ETA: I am just not sure racist is the right word. He would not be going after two women of color if he was truly racist - in fact, he would be outwardly avoiding them. I would agree that he’s absolutely misinformed and that has led to prejudicial thinking. 

What did he share that was homophobic? Just because I didn’t see that myself and I’m curious.",2,1749558829.0,greeneyedgypsy_,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion

"100%. I get why people could think the season has been slow but it’s been a lot of building pieces, even the foreshadowing with Jeremiah and huda and him getting swept up by another girl, when everything boils over shit will get insane.",2,1749527443.0,BurgerNugget12,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
yea that's fair. i lean more to the main explanation for him picking her was to draw out a storyline w chelley/he intended for amaya to try to please him when he laid down those rules and she threw off the script,1,1750178950.0,shgrdrbr,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
"and i understand not feeling him or their vibe just because i do doesn't mean i don't see why people aren't willing to wait it out.

About the girl tho im sorry but thats a scam it doesn't add up and she won't show his contact information on that Love Island text. In my mind if my man was scamming and getting on tv and told me i wouldn't say anything especially week 1 it's not like Taylor has said he's in love with Olandria",2,1749528514.0,JacquesTheHawk,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
"Yeah that’s what I said, he’s playing the game and feeding into her delusions. He’s not being genuine with her.

You can see every time she brings these things up he makes a face as if he doesn’t agree but then says something reassuring. He knows Huda will cause a scene and he thinks they’re going to win if they stick together so he’s clearly not going to be honest with Huda. 

For example the being closed off thing, he doesn’t outright say ”No I’m not closed off” he says ”I highly highly highly highly highly doubt there’s a girl that would take my attention away from you” he’s very careful with his words. It all seems very fake except Huda doesn’t know it.",0,1749561723.0,onlettertooshort,1l7n1ar,Season 7 - Episode 7 - Post Episode Discussion
