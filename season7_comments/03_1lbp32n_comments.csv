- eyal did such a great job hosting, i'd love to see him back again! 

- serena and jana on my screen again made me so happy, oh how i love them so 🥹✨ and JaNa taking stuff from the villa is so real lol

- ariana needs to be the host forever cos she's just like us, come on cream is about to have a field day as well as fellow chierra shippers 🙂‍↕️ and she just keeps getting more and more gorgeous by the day

- i lowkey didn't love the quick fire questions from the bombshells, iris didn't come off the best to me from some of her answers

- it was nice to see dasha again, seeing her so happy about all the support she's been getting and the petition was really wholesome, and i wish we could've gotten to see her explore connections with taylor and ace

- nic and ace are thing 1 and thing 2 lol i can't believe nic had a 3some with his friend 💀",120,1749953807.0,hawaiianmonkseal,1lbp32n,Season 7 - Episode 11 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion
"Sun, stress and trauma can all trigger cold sores. We saw belle-a’s lip bruise so we know trauma is happening in these challenges. We know they’re in the sun all day. Just perhaps the boy is stressing… 

I’m surprised we don’t see more cold sores on love island tbh. I’d definitely get one from the way they kiss. 

I heard a rumor once that they didn’t cast people who got cold sores on dating shows… probably more like they don’t cast people with active transmittable STIs… hopefully. ",58,1749955097.0,Forgotiwasbi,1lbp32n,Season 7 - Episode 11 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion

"After aftersun I’m definitely thinking maybe they’re all told the “top 2” in votes and the bombshell choose between them. 

Imo: 

Iris- Jeremiah and Ace 

Jalen- Olandria and ??

Pepe- Hannah vs Cierra 

And tbh this would be a good move. I’ll give the good drama but the bombshell still get a choice on the end. Plus it’ll give islanders a peep into what people think. AKA, let Olandria know people aren’t feeling her and Taylor. Let Cierra know people aren’t feeling nic for her, the Huda and Jeremiah blow etc

"As someone who specialized in virology, I am going to dispel some of the ignorance in this post: 
1. Not everyone gets cold sores ~50% of the US population under 50 have gotten a cold sore.
2. Cold sores are herpes and can be caused by either hsv1 or hsv2.
3. Herpes can form anywhere on the body but prefers 2 locations: face or genitals. 
4. There are 2 strains of “herpes”: hsv1 and hsv2. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN oral and genital herpes except the site of exposure and viral load at time of exposure.

Your way of thought is the reason why genital herpes is becoming far more prominent. That is the real problem here. 

Don’t kiss people/ share drinks/ touch your sores as it is so easily spread. If you get cold sores warn someone before kissing engaging in oral contact, sharing utensils, makeup products, never kiss babies anywhere on their bodies as the virus sheds even without a sore being present. Same thing goes for people with genital herpes warn anyone that might come into contact with your genital area. Honesty instead of ignorance will help stop the spread of herpes.",38,1749974343.0,smilesallarowned,1lbp32n,Season 7 - Episode 11 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion
