"My thoughts 
- Amaya should've checked Ace first, even if she feels Chelley is slimy, Chelley isn't coupled with you boo, so it's misplaced anger.

- Jeremiah is looking for an avenue to leave Huda, and the boys giving their opinions was it.

- Nicolandria crumbs yahhh

- Chellierra kiss was hot ü•µ 

- Chelley needs to open her eyes about Ace, he's only pursuing her, because she didn't do so.

Ace reminds me more and more of Tyrique UK season 10.  He is the leader of the villa and it lowkey feels like everybody (except Austin?) is afraid to say anything remotely negative about him. Nic agrees with literally everything Ace says, it‚Äôs getting weird. I love Chelley down but idk‚Ä¶I hope she doesn‚Äôt ignore, or worse enable Ace‚Äôs behavior. Amaya does talk over people a lot and it‚Äôs irritating but I appreciate she is not afraid to call the boys out and stand her ground.

"Good episode! Here‚Äôs some random thoughts - 

Glad they confirmed Amaya and Chelley knew each other already but how do so many people know Chelley already, did casting just go through her IG follows?!

Do they have to keep the pie etc on their face?! Why are so many of them still walking around with it - I would‚Äôve immediately wiped my face. Maybe production wants them to keep it until they get the confessionals filmed with it? IDK.

I liked that Olandria/Jeremiah convo at the top! She was real with him without throwing Huda under the bus. He annoyed me with that little forced peck during the game tho

I like Taylor but it is starting to feel a bit like he follows behind Ace like I‚Äôve seen ppl mention - even just him saying ‚Äúbe cool now be cool‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming to Chelley who was about to pie Ace. It was all in fun but it did feel a lil odd to me you don‚Äôt need to protect him lol

Amaya saying she likes toxic love?! No baby! That isn‚Äôt what you should strive for. That‚Äôs why she was still saying Ace is her #1 after 3 consecutive fights!

Amaya definitely had misdirected anger at Chelley and she rarely lets people get a word in but I at least appreciate she came at Ace with the same energy - it‚Äôs not productive but at least she‚Äôs consistent & doesn‚Äôt just give it to the woman

I don‚Äôt care about them but I randomly feel bad at how little screen time Charlie and Hannah get ü§£

I‚Äôm not one of those who wants Nic/Olandria but I find those shippers entertaining, so I like when there‚Äôs any breadcrumbs for y‚Äôall! And I admit that would be an interesting switch up if it happened.

Ace/Taylor/Nic really are the Rowdyruff Boys in maybe the worst way possible  - or maybe Alvin & the Chipmunks with Ace as Alvin haha üôÉ",20,1749617957.0,One_Caramel7003,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

Both are sus to me at this point.

What is keeping Taylor from hooking up with Olandria? She is gorge and funny, a total catch! I don't get it.

Nic and Ciara are growing on me as a couple, but I feel like he is gonna dump her soon. I would love a Ciara and Chelley plot twist tho :)

Huda and Jeramiah.. kinda don't believe either of them. They both seem to have toxic traits and are easily swayed by other peoples opinions.

And Amaya is spiraling at this point, Ace got her there for sure. His gaslighting is not even subtle. But damn, she is A LOT too.

I feel like i forgot someone, but I guess whoever it is, is quite forgettable. Sorry not sorry.

Nic is over here egging on Ace being a complete douche to Amaya. Yes Amaya was a bit much but rightfully so, Ace played her and what does Nic do. Egg it on.

"i can honestly see it from both sides with the jeremiah and huda situation. 

for huda, ik that‚Äôs probably a slap to the face to have her couple be so easily influenced by his friends in thinking she‚Äôs not being genuine and that she has bad intentions. while we don‚Äôt know if this is true or not, it‚Äôs still a crappy feeling, so i understand her wanting clarification on what happened and to why he was acting out of sorts. 

on the other hand‚Ä¶

i can see two ways in why jeremiah would be kinda reserved after the talk with the guys

first, it may have been something he HAD thought of previously, so hearing it reaffirmed probably had him second guessing in continuing to pursue huda. therefore when she came up he just needed space to think it through. 

second, could be that he HADN‚ÄôT thought of it at all so when he hears his friends concerns, it gave him a new perspective on their relationship. so now enter huda walking up, he‚Äôs maybe overthinking all of her intentions and maybe thinking they aren‚Äôt as genuine as he initially thought. 

i think he should‚Äôve made it clear that they could talk later but that he would need some space to work through some stuff, though im not sure how well that would‚Äôve gone considering huda can be a bit pushy when it comes to him. not saying it‚Äôs a bad trait per se, but people process information differently and jeremiah seems the type to need to process things on his own so forcing a response is not gonna get them anywhere.

The writing was on the wall from that first convo of the episode between Jeremiah and Huda. He‚Äôs getting annoyed with her. She was doing a lot cuz he‚Äôs made it clear it still feels too early for him to close off but he‚Äôs only focused on her rn. IDK what she isn‚Äôt getting - he did kinda snap on her tho. Then him complaining to Nick about her treating him like a child and the fact that she still told him ‚Äúgood job‚Äù this morning after he just told her the night before he doesn‚Äôt like it is kinda aggy. He even made a little comment during the challenge about bringing her 2 plates of food and she‚Äôll still complain or something like that. It feels like he‚Äôs definitely been pulling back since she told him about her child but he didn‚Äôt have much he could hang his hat on as an alternative reason. But at the end of the episode he finally got a ‚Äúreason‚Äù from the guys mainly Nic who he‚Äôs closest with. I was actually with Huda that he was moving weird off of others opinions instead of talking to her. For someone who calls themselves a communication nerd - he wasn‚Äôt giving great communication. But again it feels purposeful cuz he‚Äôs looking for a way out.

"YOOOO this is the first episode that actually got me boiling. ace gaslighting amaya in the docks and then being calm and placating her while she's clearly emotional was hard to watch. literally that whole convo was extremely triggering, especially if you have ever been gaslighted tf before. ace's whole behavior this whole episode pissed me tf off even with the game and his reaction to huda bc it's FACTS. chelley's nonchalant is starting to piss me off - it's creating problems for everybody and she can easily just pass blame onto ace instead of taking some fault as she is part of the problem as well. ESPECIALLY when it comes to austin. amaya lowkey crazy but also she's a dominican from new york lol. lol nic saying olandria is the best kisser lmao. if u don't just shoot your shot already gosh. and jeremiah's behavior is corny too, i'm not the biggest fan of huda but she lowkey right.

"Amaya‚Äôs crash outs were valid af. Before the episode so many people wanted her to keep it cute with Chelley but if she watched Ace & Chelley be all cutesy before bed just for him to tell her he has these boundaries is manipulative and sneaky af.

The boys are gaming Jeremiah and he‚Äôs falling for it because he‚Äôs not as into Huda as he lets on ofc. He probably has nightmares about being a stepdad. 

Ace and Chelley are going to make people feel bad for Austin but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be enough to save him from the next dumping. 

What was that kiss between Hannah & Austin?

"this is a stream of consciousness and my own internal debate. i have a degree in sociology so i sorta nerd out but curious on others thoughts!! 

i just can‚Äôt figure out austin. we know he is a bigot, yet he‚Äôs moving so kindly. as a michigander too, is it just midwest manners? is it some form of growth? 

i know a bunch of dudes like him. from affluent, 95%+ white suburbs of detroit. they segregation of the detroit metro area is INTENSE and deep rooted. these men are conflicting. easy enough to get along with, great for a laugh, but underneath the kind surface is some fucked up, deep rooted bigotry. 

i‚Äôm all for people being able to change and grow, but that shit takes TIME. and he was liking and reposting that heinous shit so recently. 

so i ask this to us all: do we want to send a message to production that casting ***** supporters is okay if they are nice and funny? 

at the same time though, is this just perpetuating culture war instead of class war? is he not a victim of far right ideology that has infested social media? research has shown how social media pushes these specially to young men, and takes approx 4 social media interactions for a man to be in far right conspiracy territory. should behavior be what matters here? one could make this case from and ethics perspective rooted in the cognitive hierarchy theory.  the other hand, we‚Äôve only seen his behavior 1. for 6 days 2. while being filmed on international tv and 3. how the producers decided to show it to us.

ultimately, while i think he has redeeming qualities, i don‚Äôt think i am comfortable rooting for him. if your beliefs align with a n*z*, what does that make you? i dont want production to think this is okay, nor for it to be normalized.",34,1749618230.0,ghado0613,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

"although the game Ace is playing is absolutely manipulative and wrong, i really wished Amaya could've composed herself. we can sit here and say ""it's love island, you should be here for love"" but lets bffr...there's 100k on the line AND the opportunity to meet the love of your life, PLAY WISELY!

i wish she was able to phone a friend who could tell her GIRL, stand up and keep your head held high. when a man tells you he doesn't want you, in ANY capacity, as a woman you're next best move is to say okay & act like he doesn't exist anymore (referring to their original convo after the firepit coupling). and furthermore when she peeped Ace giving Chelley a hug before bed. Amaya should've kept it to herself and next day plan on getting to know Austin. 

The reason behind Amaya's crashout was absolutely valid, the way that she went about it was not. Now everyone's back is turned against her and that is the worst position you can be in on love island

to fix her position, i think amaya needs to genuinely apologize to Chelley in front of ALL the girls. then start deepening her friendships with each one. then she should either have a quick convo with Ace saying something like ""hey, i wanted to apologize for my outburst and wish you the best"" (should she really be apologizing, no. but for the sake of the bigger picture - some battles we need not win) but she needs that air cleared out because if not, it will come back to haunt her in future challenges. then she needs to start getting to know the other men

1st: The way Ace is quickly climbing up my list of least favorite islanders. He‚Äôs so weird, the way he carries himself gives me the ick.

I lowkey think the switch up happened because the second he picked Amaya he knew he messed up and he‚Äôs displacing all his feelings onto Amaya.

2nd: Huda and Jeremiah this episode had me annoyed. Tell me how I liked Jeremiah more when he was alone talking to Nic about his feelings. Huda‚Äôs crashout at the end of the episode was not necessary and kinda controlling. The comment about how she should be the only person he talks to about stuff didn‚Äôt sit well with me.

Communication is not good this season. I feel like most of this cast just runs with what other people say instead of doing the work themselves to come to their own conclusions.

"Feel free to disagree, but after this ep I could literally do without half this cast & ill tell you why:

Keep: Nic & Cierra
I think they both have the personalities to stay in the show and continue to be relevant.

Out: Hannah & Charlie
I think they‚Äôre both very sweet & I have no problem with either of them. They just are bringing nothing to the table‚Ä¶ like I forget they‚Äôre there, I think they could be replaced with bigger personalities easily.

Keep: Olandria - I love this woman.

Out: Taylor - I like him & he‚Äôs so funny but hes also bringing nothingüò≠ like it doesn‚Äôt even seem like he cares to be there.

Keep: Chelley - I love this woman. (I don‚Äôt want to hear any negativity !!!!!!)

Keep: (questionable): Austin - he‚Äôs grown on me, and he seems like a favorite among the islanders. Everyone has only positive things to say about him, which makes me want to keep him around. BUT realistically I wonder how things are gonna go for him after Chelley inevitably leaves him..

OUT: Ace - I need this man out he‚Äôs so toxic and becoming too much of a leader among the boys. He‚Äôs constantly feeding them negativity about the girls, and I just can‚Äôt with the way he‚Äôs handled the Chelley situation. I don‚Äôt trust him even a little.

Out (I‚Äôm sorry): Amaya - I feel for her because she was treated so poorly by Ace so I feel her frustration but I think her dynamic is not good for the villa. I admire her for not being afraid to call people out, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to vibe with the girls or guys.

Out: Huda - I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cut out for this show‚Ä¶ if she wasn‚Äôt with Jeremiah I still think she would be acting this way with another man. she also doesn‚Äôt seem to vibe well with the guys or girls, like people are walking on egg shells around her.

Keep (hear me out): Jeremiah - I don‚Äôt trust this man but he‚Äôs FINE and I think if he was given the chance again to do this without Huda he could be an entertaining islander that would be a hit with bombshells and hopefully be more open than he has been so far",24,1749614568.0,Abject-Chance-2298,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

Even Austin who was initially so excited about her and whom she could have kept exploring saw her coming and said ‚Äúshe scares me.‚Äù And I get it.

I could have given it to Cierra because of the soul ties revelation but I was pleasantly surprised at how centered she was in that conversation.

"Bro Ace messy as hell. 

First of all I genuinely believed he picked Amaya just to breadcrumb Chelley. Super lame. Like double cock-blocked Austin who had a connection with Amaya and also by the way he continues to pursue something with Chelley. The entire thing was stupid af. 

He made zerooo effort with Amaya. Just went in to the couple immediately just telling her he wasn‚Äôt into her that much. Again, if you want to be hugging Chelley goodnight and planning dates for her why tf did you not choose her in the re-coupling? 

I also feel like he moved mad disrespectfully toward Amaya and Austin. I don‚Äôt even see him pull Chelley when she‚Äôs chilling on her own. Saw her making breakfast for Austin but she needs to drop what she‚Äôs doing bc he‚Äôs planned something for them. Like bruh that shit can wait until she brings Austin breakfast?? Tf. He specifically pulls her to chat like right after Austin pulls her or if he‚Äôs talking to her or doing something with her. Not just this episode. Austin will repeatedly pull Chelley while she‚Äôs on her own or with the group but I feel like every time we see Ace do it is when she‚Äôs already talking alone with Austin. Hella rude to not let them have their time. And even planning the yoga date all secretly. He‚Äôs the only one who won‚Äôt just say how he‚Äôs moving. Not saying the girl he‚Äôs doing it for even to Nic is weird af. 

Lastly, the clip of him just licking her in front of everyone at the fire pit is so out of bounds. Like not a challenge or anything. Not even really a mutual thing at first he just kind of comes onto her super physically from the clip we saw. This is the man that‚Äôs so dramatic about touching but he‚Äôs going to do all that public af to a girl he didn‚Äôt even couple up with when he could have. Grosses me out on hella levels just trying to mark his territory for real but not upfront enough to say her name at the fire pit. And on the heels of all the Amaya drama (especially the emphasis he put on not being touchy feely) and the fact that she‚Äôs coupled up with Austin and he does that like a foot away from him and in front of most of the villa is just messy and rude. 

I‚Äôm over him for real lol I wish Chelley wasn‚Äôt so on the fence and falling for his games. Idk how she‚Äôs cool with the way he‚Äôs going about things. Like she even got sucked into drama with Amaya because of how crazy Ace was moving. Do we know if she‚Äôs color blind? Because my girl is missing all the red flags! 

And he was dramatic af about Huda‚Äôs picking him during the game. He just bothers me at this point lol.

"Highkey think Jeremiah has been having second thought about getting so serious so soon and his natural inclination was to use what the guys said to take a step back from it. Otherwise, there‚Äôd be no reason for him to act that way. I truly believe that. Even its subconscious, I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. Between the mom thing and the little comments she makes to him. The guys talking sh** was a little blessing in disguise in his eyes.

Thought this the last episode, but Amaya really made a mountain out of a mole hill with that first Ace conversation and then continues to escalate conversations with everything and doesn‚Äôt let anyone get a word in. I hate it. Literally you barely knew him, so if somebody says that to you and you aren‚Äôt about it, really it should just be, like, I don‚Äôt really understand that, but I‚Äôll keep my options open, too, and maybe we end up building something, who knows, etc. Ace is definitely moving weird, but he can speak calmly and allow people space to talk. I mean, he did it with Huda. Other people gotta realize, if something‚Äôs not working for them, move it along. Ace‚Äôs definitely showing some red flags, so move it along, ya know? Idk, I‚Äôm not liking either of them, tbh.

Olandria needs to also move it along. Taylor‚Äôs not attracted to THAT BADDIE?! Like, WHAT?!? They both gotta go their separate ways. Hoping for a good dude to come in for Olandria!

"Did anyone else catch Huda backpedaling in the latest episode?
When Amaya and Ace asked her about her choices during the challenge, she gave two different answers. To Amaya, she said she picked Ace because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to pie her,‚Äù but then when Ace pulled her for a chat, her reasoning changed to ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve rather kissed you than Amaya.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ huh?

Ace made a solid point in his confessional‚ÄîHuda really doesn‚Äôt like being held accountable. It‚Äôs like the moment someone questions her, she scrambles for a new excuse instead of just owning up to it. I actually want to like her, but I feel like she‚Äôs keeping everyone (and us viewers) at arm‚Äôs length.

I‚Äôd love to see Huda push herself to open up more with the rest of the guys. Maybe then people would better understand where she‚Äôs coming from and why she acts the way she does. She was supposed to have a proper conversation with Nic and still hasn‚Äôt, which just ends up isolating Jeremiah. Now he has no one to talk to about his situation with Huda besides the girls (who she‚Äôs been calling her ‚Äúsisters‚Äù) and Huda herself.

Amaya talking with her and the other girls about how Ace has been treating her and Chelly not even bothering to speak up that Ace has been pursuing her too? It's weird and sneaky.

Amaya has bad communication skills but she had absolutely every right to get mad at BOTH Chelly and Ace. They're both making her look like a fool. Why would Ace pick her if he was going to do all this bullshit? You don't like physical touch, you don't like this, you don't like that...why didn't you fckin tell her before you choose her at the recoupling? Why even choose her at all then treat her like dirt after? Ace talking about he don't like snuggles and hugs but he PURPOSELY gave Chelly a goodnight hug while AMAYA was right there in the room? And some of yall are still praising him and making Amaya look like the villain? Are you serious?

Side note: Amaya didn't need to tell Chelly shit about her kiss with Austin. Amaya came as a bombshell and she was exploring her own connections She wasn't even that close with the girls because technically it was the same day she arrived there that the kiss happened.

"Amaya still wanting Ace or seeing him as her number one at the beginning of the episode is‚Ä¶something. But when she made a comment later in the episode that she loves toxicity, it made a lot of sense why she acts like that. Even if ace was into Amaya, he doesn‚Äôt seem like the type to want to argue or fuss about small things so they were never going to work.

Unpopular opinion: but I think it‚Äôs fine that he doesn‚Äôt want to be touched or be touchy outside of challenges with anyone unless he feels comfortable and like themüò¨. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs crazy, it‚Äôs just shows that he didn‚Äôt warm up to nor liked Amaya that way. He literally should‚Äôve neverrrrr chose her. His touchiness coming out with Chelley just shows he likes her more (which we knew that) 

Amaya‚Äôs anger towards Chelley was completely misplaced. I get the conversation needed to be had but damnnnn she didn‚Äôt even let Chelley talk! Barely got out 5 sentences before Amaya was just over talking her. Like girl how you ask for clarity but then didn‚Äôt be quiet long enough to hear it?

Amaya and Ace break up conversation wasnt even a conversation, it was just Amaya going off. I don‚Äôt blame her tho bc that was crazy of Ace to hug Chelley only then decline Amayas hug üò≠ and to plan a workout date too? Nasty work! I can say he should‚Äôve been more upfront with who he wanted to pursue but Amaya barely lets anyone she‚Äôs pissed at get a word inüò≠

"Honestly, none of this Ace drama moves me fr because this is how yns act so I just be rolling my eyes. Not tryna defend it AT ALL but I feel like I've seen people tryna look deeper into his actions, when what he's doing is the Love Island equivalent of texting five different women when you have a favorite on retainer, who you bother with extra pressure now and then, expecting her to always be there. As for the rest, he's sabotaging Huda to lock her into his roster. He coupled with Amaya to lock her into his roster, and when he realized she wasn't following his terms and conditions to not fuck up his game with his favorite (Chelley), he got mad and wanted to ice her out. It's wrong, weird, narcissistic and he don't deserve Chelley, but it's interesting watching things combust on screen and people being confused when he's doing typical loser shit.

"Thoughts

Today‚Äôs episode was fun 

Jeremiah- while I still think he a fraud. I think they guys see something else. At first I thought Ace was looking out for Huda. I‚Äôm now starting to think it was Jeremiah he looking out for. Too many guys think Huda is ruining his experience. But also taking this theory with a grain of salt cuz Ace seems to clearly run the villa 

Austin & Chelly - relationship of convenience. They are both trying to make it work because they are in a couple and feel like they should. But they don‚Äôt like like each other. Please remember Austin was all over Amaya. He just scared to fight ass for what he wants. Chelly staying with Austin is not safe. He wouldn‚Äôt have picked her had he got to pick before Ace. I will not taking this turning on Chelly. Austin is racist. Like truly this show cannot allow them to make it to the end. I see if this info stayed hidden. Bad for peacock PR. 

Ace -  I can‚Äôt stand him but he funny. I actually enjoyed seeing him actually fight for what he wants. I cannot wait until his crash out when a bombshell for Chelly comes. However I fear this set of bombshell will not be for her. They gonna let her and Ace think they comfy. Not gonna lie I was kicking my feet at that kiss. lol. 

Huda- no words

Ayama - I fear if she wasn‚Äôt crazy she would be Jeremiah type. I love how the whole villa is scared they gonna feel her wrath. Should‚Äôve never took it out on Chelly. But I feel her frustration. She has to learn to let people talk or else nobody will take her valid emotions as serious. I‚Äôm ok with her staying a one episode but then I need her to go. 

Charlie & Hannah & Cierra -are becoming forgettable. They may be the ones dumped

Nic - waiting for his next bombshell lol

Olandria - please bombshell be for her. 

Taylor - we know your kind. Cuz if you are not physically attracted to Olandria you are insane. I‚Äôm straight and I am physically attracted to her.",13,1749608258.0,Far-Telephone3039,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

"ok this is my honest take on this ep. the whole love triangle bw ace,austin and chelly is just too much. ace been wanted chelly but chose amaya to make her crash out and want him even more but his plan backfired bc he gave false hope to amaya which made her like him even more. he realized this and set boundaries with her bc he wasn‚Äôt feeling her but would do the opposite things he told her with chelly in front of austin to show him that he can basically steal his girl if he wanted to (which happened). 

i think that tay and olandria are acc rlly slow burners irl but at the same time i think that taylor might not be all that interested in bc of how slow she wants to go. but i also do think that if a male bombshell comes into the villa there‚Äôs a possibility that she might go for them? 

hannah and charlie, no words needed they so cute! 

cierra and nic‚Ä¶ i do NOT like them at ALLLL. he played tf out of belle-a. he mentioned how he‚Äôs more sexually attracted to cierra and physically attracted to belle-a so that‚Äôs the reason why he chose cierra. after his decision he clearly regretted it and that was shown to us by the way he hugged her right before she left the villa. he‚Äôs also an instigator and should worry about his own connection rather than giving jeremiah doubts about him and huda ESPECIALLY knowing that huda trusted him enough to want to go and tell him that she has a daughter and wanted to get his opinion on it. the way he moves is weird and he‚Äôs trying to make jeremiah move that way too. i get that the guys want him to explore other connections and they think him being only with huda is not the way the game should be played but i also think that they lowkey jealous bc them two clicked so fast and don‚Äôt want them to last long. 

jeremiah and huda, some of you guys will hate me but these are my end game. i am huda and she is me. i understand how she is and yes at some times she‚Äôll be extremely delusional but as someone who has been in her shoes where she wants to jus be loved she will be very attached and dependent off the rip. jeremiah has been acting the same way from the first moment that‚Äôs why she thinks it‚Äôs ok for them to be so lovey dovey and jus the 2 of them but for him to start acting differently she‚Äôll be picking up on that very quick. i don‚Äôt like how ace is always putting his 2 cents in when it has nothing to do with him and how him and nic started feeding ideas in jeremiah‚Äôs head talking abt how they think she‚Äôs jus using him to play it safe when it‚Äôs soooo obvious that‚Äôs not the case. imo it‚Äôs him playing it safe but at times i genuinely do think he likes her bc of him being concerned if she got up during the challenge to kiss someone (ep 3 or 4 idr) or him starting to overthink if she rlly likes him or not after what the guys think about her. i also believe that there are scenes we aren‚Äôt being shown bc there‚Äôs jus no way it looks one-sided on huda‚Äôs side and making it seem like she‚Äôs being crazy. how i see it is yes she‚Äôs being tooooo attached BUT being with someone basically stranded on an island together every day, 24/7, coupled up,etc, i can see why she acts the way she does bc y‚Äôall would HATE to see me on that show.",3,1749664162.0,ProfessionalCar2790,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

Belledasha- she lowkey did herself a disservice by only having the men kiss her on the cheek the first ep. I'm all for her morals and stuff but ts is not modesty island they want you innattttt but anyways she was also done so dirty by nic in soul ties like omg gtfo. I feel like her man wasn't on the show with the first set of men we were presented with but they lowkey weren't giving very much, if she was able to stay for a few more bombshells she would've been such a great girl to keep on the show, although I really like Cierra it pains me that dasha had to leave so she could stay.

Huda- i really liked her the first ep, but it's just been downhill after that. I keep trying to like her but that girl needs helpppp send her homeeee but she's also bringing all the drama and entertainment so she's prob gonna stay. Her date w J was so pointless it lowkey did nothing for their relationship it was just to give the other cast members a break of them üò≠. Honestly I think she told J about her kid at an appropriate time, it's not like she went weeks without telling him, it's just the way she approached it and how long she dragged that mf conversation out just pmo and probably stressed J out to egregious amounts. Shes also super jealous and controlling which is one thing in the real world but we're in the Villa get a grip bc J did not give a gaf when she was kissing all up on dudes for the baseball challenge but when J had to it's a huge problem.

Jeremiah- oooohhh Lord this boy pmo üôè he genuinely acts like a child and I need him off my screen now. He's so easily manipulated and he's getting manipulated by the other dudes on the show üò≠ I am so tired of his pointless conversations with Huda bc he just starts whispering and just mushes down into a puddle. And Ian clocked tf out of him with the line abt Huda missing her family üò≠üò≠üò≠ he's just so basic and him and huda can get off the show and just go ahead and live together 

Nic- nic was moving so crazy with Cierra and dasha it made me dislike him so much he was 100% giving dasha false hope abt their relationship and I'm convinced his speech and Cierra was genuinely abt dasha but he just changed his mind mid speech. He's also planting evil seeds into J's brain and it's so hard to watch Nic feeding into the drama and Js immaturity. Other than that he's funny and he's contributing nicely to the show I guess.

Cierra- honestly I wasn't too hot on her at first bc of how vague she was with dasha abt her time in the hide away but she rly grew on me bc never did I ONCE see her hate on dasha, and vise versa I love them.

Taylor- he does nothing for me I do not care about him enough to form an opinion. Next.

Ola- her man is coming don't you worry she needs to be free from the shackles of Taylor and everything will go up for her. Although she can seem kind of doubtful about most things I think it's because she's trying to be realistic and not get hopes up. However she's very insightful and I respect her for that a lot. I like the way she moves and I like that she truly is for the girls. But honestly the comment she made abt Ace on the first episode abt him being a baby and then she went and kissed him was a lil weird, but nothing too crazy. What really blew me was the way she reacted when Taylor stood up for Cierra bc she like had a visible reaction and moved away from him. But they talked it out and honestly that's all that matters so we still love.

Hannah- I love hannah SO much she is just a cute girl and shes so perfect for Charlie idc that people say they're boring it's bc they actually have a stable connection going on!! I want her to stay forever, she's adorable.

Charlie- I was so embarrassed for him when no girl stood up during the recoupling but that was lowkey a sign bc Hannah was right there waiting for him, I'm so happy he found his match. He doesn't really do much, I think he could put more effort into everything he does but atleast he's not terrorizing people!!

Austin- love this guy I knew from the jump he was gonna win us over, I just pray he's not racist üôè I think he's perfect for chell and I really hope things work out between them. His crash out abt ace was totally valid and it made me like him more, I think he just needs to put in a tad more effort and maybe some freakyness into his relationship w chelley bc i think that's what she needs. Another thing is the fact that he was worried about Chelleys connection with Charlie in the hideaway yet HE stood up for Cierra like omfg that just blew tf outta me üò≠üò≠üò≠

Chelley- one of my favs she's just a ray of sunshine I love looking at her but if she entertains any of Aces antics one more time im gonna get mad üôè she needs to stand up and leave that baby aloneeeeee!!! I still think she has potential with Austin and I have hope for their connection. She says she's still open but it's rly just Ace.

Ace- I never liked him, even when everyone said he was bringing the fun drama it made no sense to me. I need him off my screen immediately. Him choosing Amaya was the biggest blunder I have ever seen made in the history of television. But honestly I'm glad he didn't choose chelley because she deserves better than whatever he has to offer. He wants to be chased by these women pushing thirty and he's barely able to drink.... he needs to be humbled and get that tattoo removed off his back. The way he talked to huda was also so inappropriate, he was talking to her like she was one of his bros and it made me uncomfortable just watching it. He talks smack abt huda every 43 seconds but when she rightfully calls him out in a challenge it's a problem?? Ok poo..

Amaya- I want her gone too, she's just too much for me. Everyone was tweaking abt huda crying but Amaya was crying too and I think we should give her the same treatment. They gotta stop saying they like her laugh. The way she talks hits a nerve in my brain that makes me wanna throw my remote at the tv. Her eyes are gorgeous but they high key make her look crazy. I hate the way she handled things w Chelley, every conversation with Amaya is just Amaya listening to herself talk. She needs to learn to keep quiet and let other people talk. I honestly just dislike the way she acts and her attitude about everything. And stop giving people nicknames.

"My thoughts.  I'm done with Amaya and her phony act.  BIG props to Ace for trying to have a civil conversation.  I would have left her there talking to herself.  She did the same thing with Chelley.  And we're talking about 12 hours?  She's crazy!  If a dude was acting like her, after 12 hours, I wouldn't be able to get away from him fast enough.  People looking for moments are ruining these shows. 

This tired, unbelievable Chelley/Austin thing needs to just stop.  There is negative chemistry.  I love me some Chelley, but I'm starting to give her the side eye.  The way she described both of them said it all.  PS, SHE could have said no to talking to Ace's chat, but she likes him.  She could have said no to stopping breakfast, but she likes him.

I'm SO glad Ace was being proactive this episode.  

Loving the bond Olandria has with both Chelley and Ace.  She's become the house mom.  LOL. Unfortunately, don't see it for her and Taylor.

Chelley showed ALLLLLLLL her cards with the Ace kiss.  If she don't get out of here with the pretend Austin nonsense, and explore all that pent up Ace energy.

People think Ace likes Huda, but... That, ""i'd rather kiss you than her"" with her giggle, and him not being fazed... Nice to hear the boys tell Jeremiah their real thoughts about him & Huda.

Shout out to Taylor for calling Amaya out on her nonsense, to her face!

\- 1 who pied charlie and for what? U see him with pie on his face but he was neevr shown, this was before hannah got pied while shes on stage so it couldngt be her kissing him. 

  
\- 2 everyone is currently making me very bad except hannah, charlie, austin, cierra, and slightly nic

\- 3 its so painfully obvious ola is trying sum w ace , never trust ur bsf/bf

\- 4 dont get me wrong, that man is NOT chelleys bf, infact they both deserve to be single currently cus their playing w everyones feelings instead of js getting together, ace is so clearly playing the game and he gets the fuck away w it too like yall pls wake up in the villa

\- 5 im rly missing belle-a rn.

\- 6 u can always tell who think theyre a fan favorite, u can also always tell who IS a fan favorite and knows it, ex of smb who THINKS theyre a favorite - amaya , ex of smb who KNOWS theyre a favorite - nic

\- 7 ionk if im tripping but i SWORE in the first look for this episode it was shwon twice that cierra confronts nic but idk

\- 8 i seriously need charlie so bad hes perfect omg

\- 9 jeremiah is so insanely childish and whether u like huda or not she deserves better esp considering how we see she treats her partners in a relationship, she genuinly cares for them

While I don't care about Austin, and the 2 of them are fake af, no one would kiss like that in front of someone they genuinely were interested in.

I think either ace and chelley set this up beforehand OR they kinda know they‚Äôre endgame (on the show) and are playing up the storyline to get people invested and not be boring.

"personally the reason why I like Amaya is because she's not going to let a man play in her face like Ace did. She knew her worth plus the tax and called him out on his bullshit. I definitely do think that she should have let Chelly talk but if it's true about what she said about confiding in Chelly and crying to her about what Ace was putting her through I do understand why she confronted her about it. I think emotions were just heightened and she just didn't know how to react. I don't think it necessarily makes her a bad person. And I don't think people are praising her because she's light skin and more for just pointing out that she stood up for herself. Because people are still giving her her fair amount of hate and calling her annoying mainly for not allowing others to speak when its their turn. As for Olandria I wouldn't necessarily say she was dragged by people because when she talked it out with Huda everyone loved her again. I don't know if it's just what's being shown to me but I didn't really see a lot of hate thrown towards her because of the comment, besides people calling her rude.",5,1749660639.0,bbygirleats,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion

He definitely blindsided her because he seemed all close and interested to her, gave her a good speech saying he can‚Äôt wait to sleep in bed with her, and then drops a huge bomb before she can even say hey. I think it also bothered her that he says he‚Äôs not affectionate and then turns around as is affectionate with Chelley. Last thing but I think Amaya was really trying with Ace and he wasn‚Äôt at all. He could‚Äôve met her halfway and let her call him babe or something but no, he was cold from the jump and made it seem like he was a hot commodity and she should be thankful and bow down to him for choosing her.

"‚ÄúBeing okay with how Ace is treating Amaya‚Äù is a completely different conversation. Obviously after coming at me crazy when I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong will mess with my perception of you and maybe influence how I view and interpret the dynamics of the villa. 

Secondly it is not a hard rule that the og girls have to divulge every piece of information to the bombshells. That being said Amaya is a liar if she‚Äôs saying she didn‚Äôt know about Ace and Chelley because they actively have chats and he was bringing them both breakfast. 

Also if the bombshells don‚Äôt owe the ogs loyalty it is quite odd to say Chelley owes her something?? Like that‚Äôs a very strange and unfair expectation. Like here are these new people who are going to try and get in on your connections. Kiss your men and hide that information from you but you have to tell them everything about yourself. 

I don‚Äôt mean in anyway to defend Ace. I think he should have left that girl alone cause he clearly can not stand her.

"No offense, but you wouldn‚Äôt know what gaslighting was even if it hit you in the face. Ace is an insecure jerk and has been gaslighting Amaya. 

In his recoupling speech, he said that he is really excited to explore this connection, share a bed with her, stay up all night talking, etc. But before the night even ends, he tells her about all these ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù (that he could‚Äôve mentioned before the recoupling btw when they were getting to know each other) that he has. She was obviously caught off guard. That comment he made in the confessional about Amaya ‚Äúhaving serious issues and wanting the feeling of being wanted‚Äù was classic gaslighting. He‚Äôs trivializing her feelings whilst feigning concern. He doesn‚Äôt know her but he‚Äôs trying to create this image of her being unstable and needy. 

The next day, he starts telling her that he has a problem with her using the word babe even though she said that she calls everyone that. He was making it seem like she‚Äôs delusional and that her saying babe meant that he was her husband (which she clarified that wasn‚Äôt the case). He‚Äôs creating a false reality/dichotomy between them that clearly doesn‚Äôt exist. This is gaslighting. 

Even that comment he made tonight when he told the guys that he doesn‚Äôt want to explore anything with her but he didn‚Äôt tell her that because he couldn‚Äôt. Again, he‚Äôs making it seem to his boys that she‚Äôs desperate, crazy, and can‚Äôt handle the truth‚Äîcreating a different reality/image to make Amaya seem irrational. 

I can go on but the last thing I want to say is Ace deflecting and blaming Amaya by claiming that if she only behaved, reacted better, and acted differently for the situation is also another example. He‚Äôs unable to engage or take any accountability. Everything is her fault.

This doesn‚Äôt make sense because Chelley coupled up with Ace the first chance she got. Ace is the one who chose to not couple up with Chelley. So if they came and had a big elaborate plan to act like ‚Äúthey were the ones who got away‚Äù. Why are they moving so differently?

And I hear you. I just still don‚Äôt believe Chelley needed to volunteer information especially so early on if that expectation is not placed on anyone else. They should have had a less charged conversation and I ultimately don‚Äôt think this will end up being anything and they‚Äôll sort it out or move on.

"Yeah I agree with what you‚Äôre saying - he is a jerk. Literally 0 defense of Ace. 

Gaslighting is still a specific typing of lying and manipulating that generally happens over an extended period of time that starts slowly and breaks down someone‚Äôs ability to trust their own opinion and reality. 

But yeah honestly the way he made it out to her like she was coming on strong is that territory. lol I guess hes just bad at gaslighting cause to me hes directly telling her to fuck off like whip lash and isn‚Äôt trying to control her further (which in abusive settings is typically what is the goal).",0,1749612138.0,bassinlimbo,1l8gvon,Season 7 - Episode 8 - Post Episode Discussion
