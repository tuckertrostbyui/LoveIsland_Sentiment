"Ace has never been in a relationship because I'm positive he has extremely derogatory views on women and an unhealthy view on relationships because he's been formed by the manosphere. Almost everything he says is a clue, and you can see it by the way he negs, manipulates and straight up tells women what they need to do to earn him and what they're not going to do. 

Tonight he said ""I thought I'd have to go out of country to find a wife."" DING! Did that sound odd? Because it is! But also not - for anyone unfamiliar, that's a huge thing in the manosphere and red pill content. They preach that modern western women are too independent and to find a traditional, submissive wife men need to go abroad (ie, become a ""passport bro""). Their whole schtick is that western culture has killed femininity and gender roles, and western women don't respect male authority.

\-Repeatedly asking Jeremiah is he will leave her and why he hasn't asked her to be his girlfriend.. it's been TWO WEEKS. Rest. Let the man sleep.

\-Jeremiah's pancakes are raw... why not tell him this and show him how to cook a proper breakfast if he gets it wrong every morning? What's wrong with communicating? Showing him how to cook together?

\-Telling Jeremiah that Taylor came up to her and asked to help her make breakfast. Pouting that Jeremiah didn't even ask her and another man had to step up. Why can't Jeremiah be the one to ask to help her?

"Rant:

Watching Huda and Jeremiah interact is actually giving me whip lash. For example, Jeremiah will say or do something that comes across as really insensitive and hurtful and it will make me feel so sympathetic for Huda. But then 5 minutes later, Huda will act really unreasonable and lowkey crazy and it will make me feel really sympathetic for Jeremiah. They truly are the worst possible pairing because they can‚Äôt listen to each other without viewing it as a personal attack. Both of their actions and responses are controlled by their ego. A prime example is Huda‚Äôs need for constant reassurance. If Jeremiah says anything that isn‚Äôt basically worshipping her, no matter how minor the comment may be, she will crash out because he just gave her a reason to get angry and ‚Äúprove‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt truly care for her, as her insecurities have been saying all along. This is why she will end arguments by making sexual comments, because she is desperate to restore the feeling of being wanted by him. On the opposite end is Jeremiah and his inability to value or show respect for Huda‚Äôs criticisms/opinions. This is because he truly believes that his actions and his beliefs are ‚Äúright‚Äù and when Huda disagrees with him, she is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and frankly, dumb/lesser for even thinking that in the first place. This is why Huda feels frustrated when he laughs at her when she is telling him why she‚Äôs upset. He has seen her act irrationally before so now he treats everything she says as irrational, no matter how valid her point may be. It‚Äôs laughable to him how ‚Äúwrong‚Äù her point is because she‚Äôs just an emotional, unreasonable woman whereas he‚Äôs a logical, levelheaded man. In his mind, his beliefs are so obviously right because he is not ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and ‚Äúirrational‚Äù like how Huda is. Another example is when they were sitting on the dock and Huda said ‚Äúit‚Äôs crazy how men can act like that‚Äù. His facial expression and reaction showed that he not only disagreed with that statement, but literally thought she was stupid for even thinking that because that mindset is so clearly ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.",43,1749881390.0,izbae,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

Was gonna vote for ace but nah i need him to be vulnerable. Picked jeremiah instead because him and huda need to let each other breathe. Obligatory i dont like either huda or jeremiah. But they need a wedge between them.

Chose amaya purely bc i want her to stay and get a redemption arc even though i know hannah/cierra have somewhat of an actual connection w pepe.

"My takes!!

- I loved Jalen‚Äôs attention to Olandria. He seems so much more interested in getting to know her. I feel like any time I watch her and Taylor, she‚Äôs initiating most conversations. It‚Äôs really refreshing to hear her say she‚Äôs actually having fun and excited!! I think she might be more attracted to Taylor physically, but hopefully she‚Äôll feed off of the energy Jalen is bringing for her! But I also feel bad and hope he doesn‚Äôt get too fixated on just her for her to choose Taylor in the end. 

- Pepe was meh to me. I enjoyed his conversation with Cierra the best. (But let‚Äôs be honest, Cierra could talk to a wall and have better chemistry than every other couple combined so far. That woman knows how beautiful she is, inside and out, and WORKS itüòç)

- I hated the way Pepe tried to step to Charlie like that in the kitchen, it gave me the ick. Be respectful. Everyone is there to explore connections, there‚Äôs no reason to be a dick. Even Ace hasn‚Äôt flat out disrespected Austin like that. (The icing licking was a lil CRAZY, but it was mainly egged on by other islanders) Anyways Pepe rubbed me the wrong way with that comment, but maybe he and Hawk-Tuah Hannah deserve each other.

- I was pleasantly surprised by Iris and Ace‚Äôs conversations. But I still feel like I can‚Äôt trust that man at all, so it‚Äôs mainly a surprise on her part lol. He definitely knows how to talk the talk so we‚Äôll see if she‚Äôll just end up being another part of the game in Ace‚Äôs world lmao. So far she seems level headed and I liked that she wasn‚Äôt scared to pull Jeremiah for a chat to get his take on his and Huda‚Äôs connection. Hate to say it, but she had better chemistry with Ace imo. (Plus she already said she had the ick from Jeremiah being so closed off and untouchable m. And the hickey PFFT)

"My 5 cents on episode 10:


- The bombshells are HOOOOOOTTTTT, but what Pepe pulled with Charlie in the kitchen was straight up disrespectful. Pepe is stirring the pot fr, he‚Äôs gonna cause so much drama! ü§£

- I like Nic, he‚Äôs always fun to watch. The yoga class with Ace and Chelley baby was entertaining too.

- What the hell is Ace doing?!! I thought he was all about Chelley, and now he‚Äôs already drooling over the next bombshell ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- Olandria is my fav, I love that girl ‚ù§Ô∏è!! Really hoping she‚Äôs into Jaylen too, ‚Äòcause that man is goneeeeee.

- I honestly feel bad for Jeremaiah. I really believe he‚Äôs a sweetheart and would be so fun to be with, but he‚Äôs totally trapped with Huda. She‚Äôs got him on a leash and he doesn‚Äôt know how to pull back ‚Äòcause he doesn‚Äôt wanna hurt her. I really hope he gets to enjoy the show soon. It was nice how the boys reminded him that they‚Äôve only known each other for a few days and Huda isn‚Äôt his girlfriend.

I feel like we‚Äôll get a better sense of Jeremiah‚Äôs true intentions (if production actually shows it) based on how he reacts to the public vote. Right now, it seems like most people think he needs to be saved‚Äîso we‚Äôll see if he actually wants to be.

As for Huda, she‚Äôs probably going to crash out and feel insecure at first (which sucks, I feel bad for her). But maybe after she has some time to settle, she‚Äôll reflect on her behavior and relationship‚Äîand maybe see it as a sign to open up more during this experience.

2. Nic is ew. He only ever talks about physical attraction and nothing else. Even when he was trying to choose between Cierra and Belle-a, it was always about looks and physical intimacy. If there was a challenger answering questions about partners, he‚Äôd get none right.

"I know everyone is always on Taylor for not putting in any effort but I raise you Nicolas. Literally no one in that villa is doing less. Yesterday was the first time I even saw him bring Cierra breakfast and he made breakfast for Iris as well. And the thing is, he is so involved in the other boys‚Äô little plans (Ace and Taylor.) because he is close with them but it never even occurs to him to do anything for Cierra. And don‚Äôt get me wrong I agree with the people saying most of the more elaborate gimmicky dates are hollow but damn. I wonder how Cierra (she‚Äôs my favorite islander) feels about that. 

That being said, I do hope she gets coupled with Pepe, I know a lot of people voted him with Hannah but Hannah is already openly exploring and she would continue to do so regardless so I‚Äôm not worried about her. And for the people who wanted Pepe with Amaya, I think she took Ace‚Äôs poor treatment in stride and didn‚Äôt let it shake her confidence, I don‚Äôt want her getting right into another couple with another person who isn‚Äôt interested because that can‚Äôt be good for anyone. 

Cierra needs this the most in my opinion because she is so tunnel vision on Nic and being in a different couple will do one of two things, make Nic step up and take her more seriously, or make her take pursuing things with someone else more seriously. I‚Äôm good with either cause I think she‚Äôs such a cool sweet girl and don‚Äôt want to see her leave or hurt.",55,1749934919.0,A_Dee_,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

"Sometimes, when I read these post show subreddits I'm thrown off by the comments. To give the benefit of the doubt, I am hoping that people may have commented before having watched the entire episode. But, if not then I'm wondering if we're watching the same show. 

One common theme is this Jeremiah and Iris topic. In my eyes, Iris is interested in Ace, and the feeling is mutual. Secondly, Huda is doing way too much. Seeing yourself as the prize doesn't mean that your partner has to center every little thing around you. Then, to find out that she asked Taylor to make her pancakes, but get mad that Jeremiah didn't step in to tell him to not make the breakfast so that he can??? My God, that woman is a self centered, spoiled control freak. Her facial expression annoys tf out of me. Plus, she's so draining! 


Side bar as it pertains to Chelley. She's doing what she's supposed to be doing! I can't stand Ace, especially with how he treated Amaya. And feel that he's only making any effort, because things didn't work out with Amaya. My only gripe is when she was cooking breakfast for Austin, but dropped everything for Ace when he wanted to do yoga, and having him lick the cream off of her was a bit too much. Especially in front of Austin. With that said, I hope Ace changes gears and pursues Iris, because Chelley deserves better than both Ace and Austin. So, I would love for her to meet a Bombshell. Kind of like how Jalen is pursuing Ola (thankfully, because I'm not fond of Taylor and I don't trust his sudden interest in her).",38,1749938052.0,lprdgds,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

"huda and j have such an odd dynamic now, truly. 
i can actually understand wanting a little more than breakfast, the other guys make breakfast with no complaints and do more for their girls. but on the same note, huda gave him everything off rip. she has all her eggs in his basket, we don‚Äôt see her talk to the other guys at all. they kissed and showered together, they‚Äôve been intimate nightly, im sure he feels as though he doesn‚Äôt need to do anything, or doesn‚Äôt have the same fire under him that everyone else in that environment does. & huda is passive aggressive, she makes digs at j and he clearly feels that. she has no filter through her mind before she speaks, she just speaks. the first thing she said when he brought her breakfast this episode was ‚Äúno protein?‚Äù
like girl.. say thank you first. even if the pancakes were raw (they didn‚Äôt look it honestly), she could‚Äôve delivered that information better too, especially to someone she is saying she cares about! 
i can see why his patience is wearing kind of thin with her, they communicate totally different. huda desperately needs some emotional maturity and growth, and i can‚Äôt imagine how she acts off tv if this is the filtered her.

Iris x Jeremiah bc i need to see him in a couple with someone else. Just to see. He‚Äôs been restricting himself knowing he‚Äôs growing more annoyed and I can‚Äôt let him scam so easily if that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs tryna do. 

Jalen x Olandria bc he‚Äôs specifically there FOR HER. The complete opposite of Taylor and I love it. Taylor has been playing in her face and it shouldn‚Äôt have taken another man coming in for him to half ass some effort

Pepe x Amaya bc she is vulnerable rn, I don‚Äôt wanna see her leave yet AND bc he clearly wants something with Cierra but Cierra is clearly hung up on Nic as of rn.

"My diary:

I feel like the dealt Jalen a weird hand last night because he‚Äôs so muscle-y and came in wearing leather for a very sexual challenge and he came off super intense. He seems like a sweetheart. 

I don‚Äôt feel bad for Huda with Jeremiah lashing out at her. Even when he said, ‚Äúokay mom.‚Äù I‚Äôd lose my patience a lot quicker. I do wish he‚Äôd end it. I think he doesn‚Äôt like confrontation.

Ace and Iris aren‚Äôt a good match; he‚Äôs just onto the next thing for a couple days. 

Sad about the lack of Austin content this episode. I really hope he doesn‚Äôt go home. Sorry, I know we‚Äôre supposed to hate him.

I like Pepe (hot) and Amaya together, but doesn‚Äôt seem likely. I need something to work out for her because I feel like she‚Äôs been ostracized a bit from day one.

Charlie looks like a Twilight character (strong Jasper stare while thinking about Hannah and Pepe), Ace looks like he could be on a Disney channel original series, Austin is Kirk Steele, and Jeremiah looks like the bold glamour guy filter.",22,1749867914.0,soup4breakfast,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

"I get why Jeremiah is overwhelmed with his relationship with Huda. 

Huda has a lot of bad defense mechanisms- using physical intimacy to maintain attraction, interrogating to gain clarity, being possessive, and overall overbearing. 

But it‚Äôs hard for any girl when the guy checks out emotionally, has been using you physically, and is passive aggressive. It gives you all the signals he‚Äôs not interested but also part of your brain is like well he does like me in some way otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt do the other things. 

Jeremiah needs to stop saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still open‚Äù and just point blank say they need to slow down or that his feelings have changed. It moved too fast. And apologize for getting swept up with the physical stuff and that clouded his judgement because that part does mess a girl up. 

Huda was also fair to ask about where the protein was at breakfast- she‚Äôs a personal trainer. I‚Äôve never met one who wasn‚Äôt obsessed with protein. She is fair to ask for more than just walking around the villa and kisses at night. 

Huda is wrong for pushing the whole are you my boyfriends?, will you want to move in?, would you share your location?, I‚Äôm telling everyone we‚Äôre basically closed off. 

But anyways- this girl is too intense for the Villa. She needs to dip and I hope she can get a therapist to watch these episodes with so she can actually address her unhealed patterns and grow.",39,1749867475.0,lilly_1005_2007,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

"This was a gooooood episode! The bombshells are actually bomb-shelling they‚Äôre shaking things up!

Random thoughts throughout the episode:
- Hannah‚Äôs face when Huda said they were the strongest couple ü§£
- Jeremiah ‚Äúare you deadass‚Äù made me literally LOL! I get him tho. I don‚Äôt hate Huda she‚Äôs a lot but I don‚Äôt hate her. She just does entirely too much. If you think you‚Äôre the strongest couple why do you need to compare yourselves to the other couples?!  Comparison is the thief of joy
- There‚Äôs definitely a connection between Jalen & Olandria - Taylor better get it together
- Amaya being the oldest child makes sense
- I like that quick moment from Iris on the steps with Jeremiah making her intentions known
- Taylor ‚ÄúWhat are you so happy for? He don‚Äôt do the rodeo he not that country‚Äù oooh that boy SWEATING!
- Austin and Chelley cuddling?! üò±
- Share your location talks already - She‚Äôs gonna push him away I fear
- Nic double breakfasts - kind but dang ü§î
- Taylor getting handsy all of a sudden lol - I fear it may be too late - Olandria‚Äôs not dumb
- Huda ‚Äúno protein‚Äù this is what he‚Äôs talking about you‚Äôre nitpicking every thing
- Ace too cocky man - I could see Chelley actually picking Austin in a shocker moment. Cute date tho and Chelley likes the effort and Austin only seems to plan things when someone tells him to or if Ace does. 
- Also, Nic is a great wingman!
- I‚Äôm still not on the Nic/Olandria ship - but the delusion is entertaining BUT there‚Äôs no chance of that happening while Taylor‚Äôs in the villla. Nic and Taylor are too close
- She‚Äôs so nitpicky! I‚Äôm actually feeling bad at how much Huda is annoying me. Cuz I don‚Äôt think Jeremiah is an angel but she‚Äôs constantly suffocating & belittling him. I‚Äôd like to see these 2 coupled with other people to see how they move.
- To be fair neither Huda or Jeremiah are recounting these fights accurately but that‚Äôs human I guess
- Nic is funny: The caterpillar is becoming the butterfly , Charlie: the cracks are showing ‚Äî They all see it I guess. Plus Nic knows extra info so I‚Äôm curious how he‚Äôs thinking through it with that
- I like Iris, cool vibe, like that she called out the High School behavior
- Jeremiah actually seems to be putting effort into this chat with Iris
- Ace is safe - producers made sure. Lol. If Chelley doesn‚Äôt pick him it seems like Iris certainly would
- Ace and Iris do have a good chemistry (he is also just a good conversationalist when he wants to be so IDK) and Chelley and Austin are getting closer but IDK I just don‚Äôt want Chelley with Austin cuz real world stuff
- Curious to see how Ace moves with Chelley now that Iris is in the villa and they connect 
- lol at Iain saying Amaya being the voice of reason is new - I like it on her tho
- Jeremiah ‚Äúshe ain‚Äôt for me‚Äù ‚Äî yikes!
- S*x positions with Chelley and Austin was awkward
- I don‚Äôt quite see it with Nic and Iris - he‚Äôs just a horn dog lol
- Olandria seems to really like Jalen. The cheek kiss was nice. His personality doesn‚Äôt give me much but it seems to be right up her alley
- Charlie was angry with the guac I feel a lil bad / I like that he and Chelley were close enough as friends that he could vent to her. She gave some kind advice. She‚Äôs wrong he should definitely worry but it was kind to say in the moment. I could see Charlie going home at the next official recoupling. IDK what other girl would choose him if not Hannah.
- I like Pepe he‚Äôs got game and many options already. He and Hannah maybe pop the most tho / Edit: I didn‚Äôt realize on first watch all the kinda passive aggressive things he was doing to the guys like Nic and Charlie ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see how I feel about him with more eps

"I'm gonna play devil's advocate here, anyone seeing my posts knows I'm very critical of Huda.

The one thing I think may be valid is the ""no protein?"" comment she made when he brought her breakfast, and that's because she's a fitness trainer. Anyone who knows that world knows how important protein is to maintaining muscle and I feel fairly confident she's had repeated conversations with Jeremiah about their diets and gym goals, etc. So in that way I don't know if it was made in a nagging way or a disappointed ""I've told you this so often, we've talked about this"" kind of way. 

Huda is VERY high-maintenance and irritating but I think Jeremiah is also just kind of fucking around now because he's not into it and so he's just tuned out. Which I understand 100% but you gotta just pull the plug then instead of ignoring your partner or half assing it.

To put it a different way, if I really needed oranges in my diet because I was deficient in something, and I made it a point to tell my partner, and then he kept ignoring all the oranges in the fridge and bringing me strawberry smoothies, it's not like I wouldn't appreciate the breakfast, and I'd go down myself and get the oranges - but at some point I'd wonder if he is actually listening when we are talking.",39,1749933423.0,vrschikasanaa,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

Voting for Ace with Iris would mean that Chelley won‚Äôt pick Ace who could easily switch up on her like he did with Amaya. If Ace is unavailable Chelley picks Austin then when it‚Äôs time for the men to pick Austin would most likely pick Chelley.

"I‚Äôm still trying hard to root for Chelley but it‚Äôs difficult when she falls into Ace‚Äôs trap every time.

- Chelley chooses first at the recoupling and goes for Austin
- Amaya chooses Taylor (_since it seems like Jalen and Ola will be coupled up and Amaya won‚Äôt choose Ace. Also don‚Äôt think she would choose Nic_)

And that would leave Ace and Nic at the bottom with Huda choosing (_Since Iris will hopefully be with Jeremiah and Cierra will hopefully be with Pepe_). Huda would for sure save Nic.

I hate that iris and ace have chemistry but I see why people fall for his charisma. There‚Äôs something about the way he moves. I also hate that when she asked what his situation is he didn‚Äôt mention chelley at all. As if he hasn‚Äôt been grifting on her. Chelley needs to drop him 

Austin isn‚Äôt the better choice but maybe the chemistry will grow. Austin needs to be romantic he‚Äôs too passive. I don‚Äôt think chelley match is in the villa.

"I wanna make something clear...

Calling out Huda for her ridiculous behavior is NOT in support of Jeremiah. He is so clearly playing for the money. He would lead this girl and her whole kid on if it meant he got that money, then expeditiously drop them once the cameras were off. He has made it so obvious. I thought originally that she was doing the same, but her craziness might actually be authentic. 

On that note, most of the commentary being aimed at Huda is bc she's the one providing all the crazy lines and actions, so it's easier to make commentary on. But I see ppl saying it's misogyny or that Jeremiah is getting support since he's a man, and that's a BIG FAT NO. 
PLUS, Huda has a whole ass daughter. She's supposed to set an example for how to date a man to her daughter,  who is certainly going to be hearing about this as she gets older. You can't throw around how you are a mom, all while acting like you're in 8th grade playing these stupid games. 

On a separate note, I saw a TT that had Ace on live wishing someone named Shelly a happy Valentines Day. (I spelled it with an S because it was just spoken so I guess he could technically know another Shelly/Chelly) but if this means he not only knew Chelly, but was actively dating her at one point, then I hope they both get voted off. That would be sneaky and shady AF.

"Huda doesn‚Äôt talk to any of the dudes  and makes it known to anyone and everyone she‚Äôs taken - her threats feel empty . She does act and talk like they‚Äôve been in a long term relationship .

""okay mom"" was not ok. hes obv not feeling her the way he was the first few eps, but instead of being upfront hes finding things to be his ""out,"" even when huda is actually valid-- her wanting him to plan stuff the way the other guys have been for their girls is fair. why should we give him an easy out? i wanted a casa crash out, not for giving jeremiah a chance to escape without having to any accountability, especially when he cant even properly talk to huda without being mean. now of course i dont think huda has moved the right way at all, shes clearly very anxious n insecure n has done wayyy too much consistently , but shes also overcompensating cuz jeremiah love bombed n then pulled back without rlly talking to her. hes just as much of a red flag as she is n idk why we should reward him with iris the baddie.",4,1749873299.0,Ok-Raccoon8907,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

But I really can‚Äôt make excuses for her behavior at this point. If a man acted that way, I know it would be extremely alarming

That being said, I don‚Äôt like how Jeremiah keeps using language towards her that references motherhood (specifically in a negative connotation). It‚Äôs clear she has a sensitive spot for that part of her identity. He seems to throw it in her face and that probably triggers some unhealthy behavior. Not excusing that behavior, just saying it isn‚Äôt fair for him to do that either",2,1749879432.0,Quinnietakes,1laxbqf,Season 7 - Episode 10 - Post Episode Discussion

The thing that interests me is that he said it was actively discouraged from producers to talk about anything that wasn't related to the relationships happening in the villa. If they started talking about things outside of the villa, the producers would come over the microphone to say ""Islanders can you please stop talking about the outside world"") (this is minute 4:40 of the link).

Does she even truly like Jeremiah or does she just like the idea of being in a relationship? We never see her ask about him or his wants or needs.

She dropped a huge thing on him about her being a mum, and I think he's still processing it. Some people are overthinkers and need some time to process how they feel about certain situations.  Huda marked her territory with that hickey which he clearly expressed his dislike for and she gaslit him with ""I kissed you, I didn't suck your neck""  She knew what she was doing.
