"Huda should have told Jeremiah after spending the night kissing him in bed. However, I think her reluctance after their conversation shows she already knows how he will respond.

Jeremiah is pretty but trouble. Good trouble?

Ace and Chelley are clearly going to recouple together. Chelley is adorable and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised by Ace.

Olandria and Taylor are compatible but Olandria obviously wants to explore.

Speaking of Taylor, protect him at all costs. 

Speaking of Olandria, she‚Äôs going to be our flair maker this season.

Nicholas is going to explore his options but I appreciate how him and the other boys seem to be okay with Bell-A‚Äôs boundaries. Bell-A seems nice but I‚Äôm not sure this is the right place for her.

Sierra is beautiful and seems like a perfect bombshell.

I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy yulissa or austin even if I didn‚Äôt know what I know. Is it bad but right from her picture I thought she had kinda a mean aura? She has high school bully energy. And he seems to have negative chemistry with anyone. 

Chelley is GORGEOUS she has such doll like features. I hope they play to her sexual fluidity bc she seems fun. Her and Olandria definitely brought the most personality for the girls. I‚Äôm excited to see more of them. 

Belle-A might be on the wrong show. I‚Äôm medium on Huda but I think her and Jeremiah do have crazy chemistry off the bat. 

Ace seems fun messy instead of evil messy I see him being great television. Nic is definitely a fuck boy but he gets a lil extra points for being a nurse. Jeremiah is NOT gonna respond well to Hudas mom news.

"Alright alright alright!! 

Taylor and Olandria are my favorite couple. Lowkey hope their country asses stay together until the finale. They‚Äôre cute together but idk if there will be a bigger spark- especially since she kissed Ace in the challenge. 

Yulissa and Austin are my least favorite and they would be even if we didn‚Äôt see their TikTok‚Äôs before the show. 

Chelley mentioned she‚Äôs bisexual in her intro - I wonder if they‚Äôll send any bisexual bombshells into the villa. 

Ace is gonna be a player. I think he‚Äôs gonna make his way to Chelley next, but I can see him being popular with bombshells so we‚Äôll see if his head turns. 

I know Nic is gonna be popular with bombshells too, that kind of white boy always is. I loved Ariana clocking him when he said physical touch was his love language and she said he likes ‚Äòem horny.

I thought Charlie kissing Belle-A on the cheek was sweet but I wonder how long she is going to last on the show with all of the kissing and other physical contact that goes on during challenges etc. I like her but idk if this is the show for her. 

Jeremiah is going to break Huda‚Äôs heart. I don‚Äôt trust him - I think he didn‚Äôt kiss Yulissa because he was not attracted to her, not because he felt loyal to Huda already.

It's even more deceptive to me to wait until someone is really into you and then break it to them if they don't want to be a father or if that doesn't fit into their life plan.

Jeremiah is gonna be a lover boy player. He rejected Yulissa because he knew he didn‚Äôt like Yulissa üòÇ can‚Äôt blame him there but I don‚Äôt expect that energy to be solid for EVERY girl. 

Nic was exactly what I expected him to be. He is going to be messy. 

Belle-A‚Ä¶ I liked her in the first half but she‚Äôs got some weird ass energy. I don‚Äôt like this ‚Äúsweet pristine Church Girl‚Äù act? This is Love Island. Pucker up buttercup, why are you here??? 

Chelley and Olandria can do no wrong. Love them. However - I can tell that the fans of s6 are wanting to recreate Serena/Kordell energy with her & Taylor, or with Chelley/Ace. That‚Äôs why everyone is dogpile hating on poor Olandria for kissing Ace. They want their safe cute couples all season long üòíüòí let the girls PLAY! The men are playing!!!

Ace.. yeah I get it. He‚Äôs cute and he‚Äôs funny and he brings CHARM. But he‚Äôs a player. He‚Äôs gonna make waves. I don‚Äôt want him for any of the girls so far, personally.

"Belle-A is giving performative with the phrases she‚Äôs throwing out. Just not being herself. 

Nic seems chill. 

At first Tyler seemed cool but nah something feels off. Trust me lol

I‚Äôm aware of the reason for the mass hate on Austin. Even without all of that, he is genuinely giving blahhh. Hearing him talk reminds me of having convos with my 9 year old and his friends.

I keep seeing people hate on Jeremiah as well, not sure why. He also gives me bad vibes.. doing the birdman hands at Huda during the first coupling, saying he will always act like kid. Red flags for me.

Olandria seems very open to the process but she HAS made a few playful, teasing comments that I picked up. Still too early to tell but this kind of backhanded teasing it can turn your partner from laughing to plain annoyed over time.

Huda not telling the boys about her having a child gets no from me. I simply do not agree with that decision. If you wait to tell someone important stuff until they‚Äôre already hooked, that‚Äôs not love, it feels manipulative. People deserve to know who they‚Äôre dealing with before getting too deep.

Ace gets a no from me. Periodt.


Chelley 1. Seems to be mature and there for genuine reasons. 2. Gorgeous in my opinion.

"I know it‚Äôs just the first episode, but I would like to rank the couples based off of how I feel about them personally:

1. Olandria and Taylor - as a fellow Gemini myself, I‚Äôm jumping for joy. Both Gemini what are the odds. I liked their vibes and I want to see them make it to the end of the show whether or not they remain coupled with each other ‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è

2. Nicolas and Belle-A - this is frankly a distant second based on likelihood of longevity. Not sure if Belle-A signed up for the right dating show. I don‚Äôt think any of these men are ‚Äúgood Christian‚Äôs‚Äù like she is hoping for. I like Belle-A, but I feel Nicolas could very well jump towards the female bombshell (Sierra) the first chance he gets‚Ä¶‚úùÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏è

Honestly the rest of the couples I don‚Äôt see them sticking together based off first impressions:

3. Shelley and Austin - I love Shelley. I just think she had more chemistry with Ace than she had with Austin. I definitely think both Shelley and Ace will more likely get together by the time re-coupling comes around, but we‚Äôll see (also let‚Äôs not forget Austin‚Äôs shady past üïµÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

4. Huda and Jeremiah - I love Huda. But I really hope she jumps for the male bombshell (Charlie). I just don‚Äôt think Jeremiah is as genuine in his attraction towards Huda like he thinks he is (also Jeremiah had a shady past üïµÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

5. Yulissa and Ace - I was deeply pissed when Yulissa stole Ace from Shelley at first coupling. Knowing her shady past, I can‚Äôt wait for Ace to re-couple with Shelley the first chance he gets. But I also think Ace could become the centrepiece of all the incoming drama considering how many girls he has shown interest for (Shelley, Olandria, Huda, maybe Sierra)

The coincidence behind that is crazy, in my opinion. I'm a firm believer in that invisible string theory and I feel like they are a prime example of that.

"My thoughts so far:
Olandria: Probably my fav. She‚Äôs beautiful and funny. I see her and Taylor having more of a friend vibe. He‚Äôs funny and seems decent, but I feel like she‚Äôs out of his league.
Huda: She should have been upfront about having a kid. No point in building a connection with someone and not mentioning the kid, which may be a dealbreaker. She seems sweet and naive too.
Chelley: Not a ton of thoughts yet. They need to get Austin away from her. Not sure if Ace is a good fit either but anyone is better than Austin.
Bella: Makes no sense on the show. No one should pressure her to do anything but this is a show where people all kiss and make out for challenges. It‚Äôs as absurd as a virgin signing up for THTH. 
Yulissa: I hear Cardi B when she speaks and it‚Äôs not a good thing. Annoying af. And she‚Äôs a racist so she needs to go ASAP. 
Jeremiah: The hottest guy imo. I don‚Äôt really trust him and think he will be out of there once Huda mentions her kid. I did appreciate how he turned his cheek to Yulissa, though. That was great. 
Ace: He‚Äôs a cutie but I don‚Äôt know exactly what I think of him yet or who I see him with. Huda might be a cute coupling but I don‚Äôt think he would be a step dad at his age. I don‚Äôt really see him with Chelley either, I‚Äôm getting kinda fwb vibes? Idk like flirty friends rather than a couple.
Taylor: Seems like a nice guy and I like his talks with Olandria I just don‚Äôt see him as her match. 
Nick: He‚Äôs kinda cute, I feel like he‚Äôs sluttier than we think, though. I would have liked him with Olandria otherwise but I don‚Äôt trust him.
Austin: He sounds high or drunk all the time. Seems he‚Äôs also racist so he needs to go with Yulissa. 

No thoughts on the bombshells yet. But so far none of these men are cute to me. It‚Äôs gonna be hard to find men that can hold a candle to Miguel and Cordell.",4,1749010689.0,opisica,1l2ufwn,Season 7 - Episode 1 - Post Episode Discussion

"I know that if the roles were reversed and I were in a situation where a man didn‚Äôt tell me he had a child until after we developed more of a relationship, I would be livid.

But even if I did want kids, I would find it weird for someone to keep such a large part of their life from me if they‚Äôre serious about a relationship. While I understand trying to figure out someone‚Äôs intentions before committing, that should happen through honest communication.

"I think there‚Äôs a key difference in the reasons someone might not tell people right away. One reason might be that it‚Äôs a super personal part of her life that she really treasures. And that she doesn‚Äôt welcome everyone into her heart until she finds them to be a person she wants to share it with. Caution in opening the deepest parts of yourself to someone until you know they‚Äôre worthy of welcoming into your life. Another reason might be fear of rejection. That they won‚Äôt like you if they know. And you want them to like you so much that you don‚Äôt tell them. The first approach can be a really thoughtful way of dating in taking your time to make sure this person is who YOU want. But the second approach isn‚Äôt a great foundation for a relationship. Fear that they‚Äôll abandon you if they know the ‚Äúreal you‚Äù is making yourself into someone you‚Äôre not and assuming they‚Äôll like the character you‚Äôre cosplaying better than the real you. It also prevents someone from getting to know and love the person you really are and the life you really live.

"I think that's probably what it was.  Subtle brag about her financial independence that accidentally opened the door to the other thing.

I think there's something a little genuine to her, but also maybe prone to tipping all of her cards way too fast.  Somewhat endearing, but also confusing that she's trying to hold one single very important card close to her chest.

"I have not watched episode 2. This thread was for post discussion on episode 1 which is why I looked it up, cuz usually I'm able to avoid spoilers with these episode-specific threads. I'm assuming Yulissa gets booted. 

I read the comment you responded to in this thread which was talking about Yulissa using the n-word, so I thought you were saying Chelly should be warned about Yulissa because then she can tell Ace about Yulissa and/or go after him more freely or something. Clearly that was not what you were referring to in your comment. I knew nothing about Austin and his comments on black people. That's unfortunate and surprising considering he seemed genuinely interested in Chelly and didn't even get up to kiss anyone else in that game at the end of episode 1. 

And when I said Ace should be warned about Yulissa more than Chelly, it was more of a general comment about how it should be a higher priority to inform the person who's involved romantically with the problematic person than to inform the others about the problematic person. That obviously applies to Austin and Chelly as well, and I'm not trying to say the others shouldn't be made aware either. I was just talking about who should be prioritized in receiving this info in general. I agree that Ace isn't interested in Yulissa romantically though. 

But again, I thought your comment was referring to Chelly being warned about Yulissa, not about Austin, because that's the only context I had from reading the comment you responded to. This specific comment thread didn't mention Austin to my recollection and I hadn't looked up stuff about the cast outside of what I had seen on the show and in this  Reddit thread. Clearly, a lot of people do investigating and look up stuff about the cast way more than I do.",1,1749250036.0,memuemu,1l2ufwn,Season 7 - Episode 1 - Post Episode Discussion
