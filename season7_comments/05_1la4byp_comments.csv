"A lot has already been said about Huda being abusive to Jeremiah and I thought it was kind of overstated until tonight but yeah we gotta talk.

While I‚Äôm glad she told Nic so he has someone to talk to about it, it ends up being another way she can control who Jeremiah can turn to for emotional support. The only reason not to tell everyone in the villa and be open about it at this point is if she‚Äôs still thinking about connecting with any of them later and doesn‚Äôt want them to be weirded out.

"Random thoughts:

- I could see Olandria being the dark horse winner (regardless of her partner) - I was on the fence with her ep 1 but she quickly grew on me and she‚Äôs been my top person the past 2 eps
- Nic/Olandria I‚Äôm still not on the ship but y‚Äôall are fun! And I do find myself looking at them in the eps haha
- Hannah‚Äôs grown on me as well at least from my first impression
- Y‚Äôall say you have a hard time understanding Taylor but for me it‚Äôs Jeremiah he mumbles a lot lol
- Odd for Jeremiah to say if Nic isn‚Äôt worried about the kid, he shouldn‚Äôt, but like it‚Äôs not Nic in the relationship why would Nic worry
- I don‚Äôt want Austin with Chelley for the obvious real world reasons but I liked that he did still bring her breakfast regardless of what Ace had going on
- Ace is finally applying pressure BUT he gets too cocky about his place sometimes. I could easily see that backfiring. Also his faces while Amaya was getting kissed by the bombshells calm down on the theatrics please I mean she did the same but still
- Taylor also finally putting in some effort ‚Ä¶ but IDK if it feels natural yet. We‚Äôll see how Olandria and Jalen get along
- Oooh both Olandria & Chelley have septum piercings! 
- I actually didn‚Äôt mind Huda asking Jeremiah to do more cuz he is pulling back and I‚Äôm sure she feels it BUT that was a terrible time to bring it up
- Also the captions even the ones they put into the actual episode were off üôÉüòÇ
- The way Jalen cut Huda off mid sentence with the kiss LOL
- The Huda backbend was too much but it did make me chuckle
- Everyone else just had a fun time with the challenge so I wish those 2 would‚Äôve done it all in good fun too. Instead of him pouting and her doing what she did. I did like he at least gave effort to the kiss this time and he noticed the double standard. I‚Äôd be interested to see that instead of them leaving they both just couple up with other people how they‚Äôd move",26,1749788598.0,One_Caramel7003,1la4byp,Season 7 - Episode 9 - Post Episode Discussion

"Unpopular opinion: I think Ace did actually like Amaya and his boundary talk was a manipulative tactic that he thought would work on her to like him more. Like he said to the boys, girls like you more when they are told no. She called him a player instead though, and now he‚Äôs going crazy trying to impress Chelley. That‚Äôs the only explanation on why he still seems so bothered by her. He likes chelley as well, so if she ends up rejecting him for Austin, I can see him giving her the same attitude.",23,1749787606.0,HistorianEffective94,1la4byp,Season 7 - Episode 9 - Post Episode Discussion

Huda/Jeremiah: this is just the beginning, and I can‚Äôt wait to watch the downfall of this mess 

Hannah/charlie: she seems fun, Charlie there is just something missing about him. Like his scenes get cut but he needs to bring more.

Does Huda think that being called mommy by adults is innocent? Idk but to me it‚Äôs kind of immediately a kink thing when two adults are calling each other mommy or daddy when they don‚Äôt have a relationship around a child who calls them those things. Like 100000% innocent for a child to say that or to say it around a child but it just feels different in these contexts. Idk.

"Trying to think of a producer here and ranking the boys and girls by who I think brings the most and least in terms of entertainment value.

If you were a PRODUCER, who would you want to save from elimination? I think based on storylines Ace, Chelley, Huda, Jeremiah, Nic and Olandria feel the safest.

"this season feels so manufactured. the whole conversation with nic and huda sharing secrets did not feel natural. jeremiah's sudden switch up on huda feels deliberate now that everyone is bored with them (besides the fact that she is insufferable). rumors started to spread about taylor being there for clout + people were very disappointed in his coupling with oliandra, so now they're almost forcing their relationship. no one is making any commotion about hannah + charlie, so they're kind of just there with no drama or spice. 

idk. s6 felt like it put the ""reality"" in ""reality tv."" this season? not so much. i'm bored and things feel predictable.

"OK, so about 3/4 of the way through the time they split the boys and the girls into two groups and they send one group to a completely separate villa called Casa amor and they introduce a whole new group of women and a whole new group of men like seven brand new bombshells to each separate villa of men and women. So the boys are separated from all the girls in their own villa and all of a sudden have seven new girls to spend time with and the same for the girls, They have like seven new boys to spend time with. They stay in Casa amor and with the other gender at the regular Villa with the new group of single people for like 3 to 5 days and then at the end they get to decide if they want to bring someone back From Casa or from the time they had away from the other gender at the main villa. So they all gather together and see who is going to bring someone from that new group of single people back when both genders mix back together in the main villa. So in the past, there are couples that will be together for like the whole entire love Island and then they get completely separated for casa amor and one partner meets someone new bc they‚Äôre completely separated from their partner for like five days and they bring back a new person and then all hell breaks loose lol Because you don‚Äôt have your regular couple staring at you while you‚Äôre trying to get to know a new person, they totally separate the genders in different houses so they can get to know new people without any interference from their current partners",3,1749788031.0,phbalancedshorty,1la4byp,Season 7 - Episode 9 - Post Episode Discussion
