"QUESTION

In older seasons, even last season actually, someone not coupling up immediately did not mean throw the connection away. Eg: Maura and Curtis being in the show from very early on and only getting together after casa OR Jordan developing feelings for indiya after asking Anna to be his girlfriend or Liv and Rob coupling up calling it off then deciding they actually see something there (right before casa so they never got to explore it) 

But this season it‚Äôs like, if you don‚Äôt immediately kiss it‚Äôs wraps. Pepe never speaking to Cierra again? Ace never speaking to Iris again? What is going on. It‚Äôs like when they find someone they lock in and wait for new bombshells. Can you mingle amongst yourselves???

"This was such a fun episode and I'm glad the islanders all voiced how they felt.

Jeremiah holding firm on bis boundary with Huda and being open to Iris was good to watch. I love that he specifically named her name-calling. It was also good to sew Huda accepting it was done in the confessionals...babygirl was wearing all black for a while there. (Even though I predict they will come back together)

Good job Cierra for handling Huda with such grace and helping easing her out of that bad spot. Cierra's communication skills and emotional intelligence has been great so far (see the Nic Belle-a traingle) but it was most especially great here. State the bad behavior, what was at risk, and the push for a new opportunity.

Also good on Taylor for speaking candidly with Huda. That one interaction explains why Olandria is sticking with him. 

Olandria clarifying to Chelley that she and Taylor do kiss, even if infrequent, was something. Chelley saying she expected cuddles from Ace on their first night but didn't get them, but they had some kisses before going to bed, was also something.

Austin and Amaya - two energies matching, love it for them.

Hannah and Pepe - good for you both. A stress reliever is a stress reliever. I don't think Hannah has forgotten about Charlie, as evidenced by the emotions when Meg brought him up. I hope Hannah doesn't read too much into it.

Megan THEE Stallion - the excitement from a true viewer definitely helped the islanders. I don't know if she was okay with being touched in the game but she played it off well

Huda clocking Ace's excitement for the new bombshell - she's not wrong to point it out.

"First and foremost ‚Ä¶ ANDREINA IS FOOOOOOOIIINNE!!!!!!!

Anyway, this was a chill kinda filler-ish episode for me but it was fun and definitely needed after so much chaos! 

Glad Taylor, Olandria, Amaya & Cierra spoke directly to Huda with their concerns. And it actually feels like both she and Jeremiah are actually ready to move on. Oh and I didn‚Äôt comment on last episode but that was exhilarating! Glad Jeremiah made the healthy choice. I did feel bad for Huda when she dropped down crying until she then came out her door twisting his words and kinda bad mouthing Iris. So this episode I was glad to hear Olandria specifically say don‚Äôt be mean to Iris.

IDK how long Huda has left tho. It feels like the writing is on the wall for her. They could surprise us and TJ and Huda hit it off. But rn it feels like the bombshells will end up with Iris and Jeremiah or some variation things that sends Huda home since there‚Äôs more girls rn. IDK if Jeremiah will have enough personality for the bombshell but I see him choosing whoever else is left before Huda and not sure who else would couple up with her if not TJ.

"All I‚Äôm gonna say is I don‚Äôt care what those producers have to do. Prayers, snatch & grab, get on their knees and beg Miguel for his contact list, I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care. But the Casa boys better be 10s all around because this is just unfair at this point. Those boys do not deserve a bombshell that pretty when the girls have gotten crumbs all season and the og boys were barely anything either. Not to say the boys we‚Äôve gotten so far aren‚Äôt attractive, but I just don‚Äôt see any real matches physically or personality wise.

Also I know people talk about how hard it is to cast boys for love island because the type of guys we want to see (Miguel) that are mature and want to settle down don‚Äôt want to be on the show. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the producers HAVE to send in a supermodel bombshell for the guys and nothing for the girls. The girl bombshell doesn‚Äôt have to be THAT pretty if you don‚Äôt have a boy bombshell that‚Äôs equally as attractive. In my opinion, Andreina should‚Äôve been saved for Casa because she‚Äôs giving Daniela vibes.

\- jeremiah being grateful that iris spent so much time comforting him, but can't see that huda simply wanted the same when the public's vote paired him with iris is **MIND BLOWING**. honestly, if huda hadn't been so vocal + bullying to iris, I think jeremiah would be seen in a completely different light.

Olandria was the only girl who kissed Nic the 1st night during the matching up, so it shouldn‚Äôt have been a shock for anyone he would consider Olandria since Belle-A wasn‚Äôt giving him the type of intimacy/closeness that he wanted and no other girl was showing him interest.

"I am still confused on what the girls' mindsets were for saving Huda because even Cierra admitted that she was conflicted on saving Huda because she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to move on from the Jerimiah situation. The rest of the girls I'm guessing saved her because they think she deserves a second chance at finding love. The thing that made me confused was the girls getting mad that Huda went to talk to Jeremiah after the recoupling and saying it was disrespectful to them because they decided to keep her in. Sisterhood sometimes means tough love and I feel like all of the girls are just performing this sisterhood instead of actually having built one. The only person who seems to validate their vote for Huda with reasoning was Cierra everybody else was just holding their tongue and going along with what the other girls were doing. The girl's dynamic is not healthy because they don't properly communicate their issues and real feelings for the sake of peace, which I think might cause resentment towards Huda in the future for any wrong moves like the whole we are not saving her a 3rd time convo.

"There really is a double standard when it comes to abuse. People don't take it seriously coming from specific women.

The reactions to Huda show this.

Imagine if Jeremiah called her a bitch and told her that making him pancakes was the bare minimum, so she should step it up. Or if after a breakup, Jeremiah interrupted her conversation with another woman to try to emotionally manipulate him and get him to kiss her. He'd be off the show.

Or, to be fair, if a black woman did all that. She'd be hated until she's kicked off. Called aggressive and scary.",5,1750457879.0,TheOneThatCameEasy,1lfsbxo,Season 7 - Episode 15 - Post Episode Discussion

"ALOT of fans have a parasocial hatred for Huda, they do this EVERY season, its frankly getting SO annoying. They hate the woman so much that you cant talk about another islander without them bring her up or even compliment her without them fighting back with something negative. They complain that atmosphere is dark and gloomy but litterally voted for it then complained about it MORE. Theres finaly a light hearted episode thats not even that bad, YES, she didnt apologize and I think she should have, but again you just have more people continuing to complain like its the job they get paid to do. The atmophere has been dark but the people online are doing nothing else but contributing to that darkness by only bring more negativity. A lot of their ""advice"" comes from hate and not wanting to see her grow and simply just ""wanting her off their screen"". While some people do generally seem to want her to get help, thats amazing, I think accountability needs to be taken where accountability is due ON BOTH SIDES. the show is NOT supposed to be this deep for yall to hold this much hatred for people.

"It's the least she could do after voting to keep her there. Honestly it's not being a girls girl to keep someone who is clearly having essentially a mental episode and needs professional help on this high scrutiny reality show.

Being a girls girl here would be allowing her the opportunity to get what she needs. Which isn't more love island. It's going home and seeking help. No need to wind her up more only to have her unleashed back on her family and daughter.

Lord knows I feel for her daughter.

"I'm gonna be honest. Maybe mods will delete my comment because it's too honest. I know this show is mostly women viewers so I constantly see this same point made by women viewers about any woman who comes in with a giant booty. But maybe TJ just is not your type and that's okay. Conversely most of these women on the show are not my type. New bombshell included. Honestly I really only find Hannah and Amaya attractive out of the whole cast from a total package standpoint. I like a woman who doesn't have a gigantic booty personally, and I think that's okay. I want to make it clear that's not to hate or be disrespectful to any of the other cast members as they're good humans. It's just personal romantic/attraction preference. So although I'm not a knockout myself but consider myself a decent looking guy, I wouldn't glance twice at anyone but Amaya or Hannah in a real public setting. It's getting tired watching the female gaze dictate who is a 10/10 to the men who watch this show too and declaring every new woman bombshell perfect while the men are ALWAYS ugly at first (until people get attached to them i.e. Jalen, Kenny, etc).",10,1750402209.0,OleCrazyLegsMcgee,1lfsbxo,Season 7 - Episode 15 - Post Episode Discussion

"i feel like a lot of people will disagree with me, but at this point i don‚Äôt think jeremiah IS to blame for the toxicity in the house getting to the level it did. the worst things he‚Äôs done is spray cologne on her bed and not check up on her after the recoupling. 

which i feel like people ignore that he told the guys abt the cologne in the morning and asked them ‚Äúthats a cute gesture right?‚Äù and they told him it‚Äôs toxic. that day is when he again tried to have a calm talk with huda abt how they can navigate the turmoil, and try to be friends. was it shitty? yeah, but at that point he still wanted to try with her, and i think he thought itd comfort her bc he wasn‚Äôt in the bed. i still think it was shitty, and i‚Äôm glad the guys said something abt it being toxic. i also think jeremiah actually heard them out on that, because of how he went abt that convo with huda 

on not checking up on her, he seemed stressed af that night and honestly idk if i was him if i‚Äôd have checked on huda. i still think he should have, but him not didnt warrant huda‚Äôs level of reaction in any sense. she didn‚Äôt have the ability to understand while she was wondering if america broke them up because of something we saw jeremiah do, that jeremiah was going through the same thoughts. it never even crosses her mind as a genuine consideration that we saw her as the problem, or both of them equally. 

even today she said ‚Äúwhether or not, im partially to blame‚Äù and then ‚Äúwe‚Äôre both to blame‚Äù which to me just shows she clearly thinks it‚Äôs all on jeremiah still

also, love that jeremiah only had to be told one time not to talk about huda anymore and he instantly listened. im hoping this trend continues for him. also sorry this comment got insanely long",7,1750391858.0,korrarage,1lfsbxo,Season 7 - Episode 15 - Post Episode Discussion

"It depends on what producers want to do. It‚Äôs been done before in UK S10. 

Molly was sent home when a bombshell coupled up with her partner (Zach) and she got flown home, went on Aftersun, got her phone back and posted on insta stories and then got flown back a week later and dropped in as the last casa girl walking into the villa.

Somewhat like this season viewers had no say in her elimination (as the bombshell picked him at the end of their first day in the villa and then the text came through) so she had never been in a bottom three and it was later revealed post-season that Zach had been telling all the boys and producers that he wasn‚Äôt feeling the bombshell and that it didn‚Äôt compare to Molly and he kept bringing her up - this was not included in the edit, so it seemed like he had moved on really quickly and she was coming back to ‚Äúconfront‚Äù him in a way.

So it will really come down to if the producers consider our vote for the bombshells as us having a hand in Charlie‚Äôs elimination or not (poll after his exit said 90% of viewers disagreed with the islanders decision which is pretty decisive for a LI app poll?), and how Hannah is moving in the villa. 

Although tonight‚Äôs episode showed her and Pepe doing bits, I find it more interesting that the girls all automatically said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a touchy subject‚Äù when Megan brought up Charlie‚Äôs elimination and the cut to Hannah looked like she was trying not to cry again. So I feel like producers are hiding something with Hannah‚Äôs edit rn and how she described her and Pepe in the episode seemed weird too where she alluded to trying to foster an emotional connection but the verbiage in the beginning of that part made me think she‚Äôs not feeling it/it‚Äôs not that deep but she‚Äôs trying to make an effort. 

So I‚Äôm very curious to see what happens with the new bombshell and Pepe, and Hannah‚Äôs journey up to Casa because something currently seems off but I think it‚Äôs the edit? 

Currently I‚Äôm undecided if producers will take this opportunity to make this season even more like S10 than it already is (it‚Äôs really like UK S10 with hints of UK S7 if I think about it).",2,1750402788.0,auller1014,1lfsbxo,Season 7 - Episode 15 - Post Episode Discussion

"I love the women from this season!! 

last season did have a more women versus men energy (hence why Liv got voted off because she was making friends not matches üò≠). That group didn't have to be media-savvy or play the game well bc they didn't know they were going to gain careers from this. This group is much more aware. 

Also there just isn't a bond across all the girls and based on public and islander voting - anyone can get it. Hannah is kind of just there and pretty neutral. Amaya really rides for Huda but then Amaya and Chelley were at odds over Ace. Chelley and Olandria are close, and maybe you can add Cierra in the bunch. Iris doesn't feel like she's trying to make friends lol.

Both sides'ing this is minimizing that behavior. You can call out behavior without it being HATING or HATERS. Do people cross that line into maliciousness and harassment and using her as a punching bag, to make themselves feel better? Absolutely. It's a reality show like any other in that sense.

But to downplay what's happened on this show is suspect to me.

Also for the men, I actually think the reason people find them ugly at first is because some of them come in freshly shaven.

Disclaimer that I'm not usually someone who wants/expects Islanders to come back once they're dumped. 99% of the time they're dumped for a reason and there's no point bringing them back. But Molly coming back made sense because there was a storyline for her to come back to, and Charlie is the same.

Maybe Charlie dinged someone's Maserati leaving his audition and that's why they dumped him so brutally and then rubbed salt in the wound with the subsequent references to it. Maybe he will just fly back to the UK and eventually have an awkward conversation with Hannah at the reunion.

From what I can recall, Nic, Ace, and Taylor have had these conversations with other people, but never outright said to Jeremiah that they don't want to hear it anymore.

Huda received much more patience and uplifting chats to ""tie up"" the situation. In my opinion, Jeremiah has been left to sit with the emotional dump that Huda attempted to leave him with.

"the downvotes are coming from me too! 

my issue with huda is that she was over-invested for a 10-day relationship. she didn't explore and she didn't start mixing and mingling. furthermore, that listening to conversations has to STOP and she needs to choose to leave some situations alone. and he might be a PAB but that's something you say to your girls in a group chat not scream across a set. 

my issue with jeremiah is exactly what ace and nic were saying messily - he wasn't 100% despite seeing huda in front of him being 100%. he wasn't comfortable with her being a mom - hence why olandria was constantly like you gotta lock in. he has been paying lip service but when the bill comes due he's not answering 100%. heavy on that having sex with her but then not standing by her knowing that this is important to her. now should he be called out of his name - nope. **but you don't see the other women running to pair with him.**

with that said some of these people in the comments act like this regularly. like y'all -  its a REALITY TV SHOW. like where are my love is blind, too hot to handle, temptation island, bad girls club, RHOA girls - because this is light work. like we saw amaya also blow up - reasonably this season - and Leah blow up last season.",2,1750449433.0,hidd3nhydrangea,1lfsbxo,Season 7 - Episode 15 - Post Episode Discussion

"It‚Äôs possible but unlikely they edited that much in Jeremiah‚Äôs favor because Love Island gets no benefit from that, I‚Äôd venture to say they(the other islanders) see less than we do of their actual conversations since they talked about how little they used to interact with other islanders since they were so loved up. Huda says he love bombed her, she said love you bye first day, Huda made it sound like Jeremiah told her he was going to swerve kisses and such for her, Jeremiah himself has said it was so he didn‚Äôt get stolen by Yulissa and out of respect, this is not to say Jeremiah carries no blame but if one person is to blame more than the other, Huda is the one that has taken it to extremes. I wish her all the happiness outside the villa but inside, I don‚Äôt want to see her behavior rewarded with a redemption narrative.

When I said ‚Äúnobody is trying to police anyone,‚Äù I meant exactly that, I‚Äôm not telling anyone to stop talking, just saying that the constant negativity gets exhausting, especially when people act like they‚Äôre above the drama while contributing to it. And the ‚Äúno room to talk‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a dig cause I know i sure a hell dont have any. it was more about the irony of people preaching growth and accountability while simultaneously rooting for someone‚Äôs downfall.
