Bella‚Äôs forced blaccent is so cringe. Just be yourself girl. I think she needs a Christian football playing frat boy from Utah to come in for her.

"Huda seems to be romantically immature if that makes any sense. According to her, she‚Äôs been single since the age of 19, roughly the same time she took on the responsibilities of a mother. She's matured to handle the mom duties but still carries some of the mindsets of a teenager.

"Olandria can do no wrong to me. I love how she‚Äôs moving. Taylor and her have a mature relationship and hopefully whatever happens they end this thing respecting each other.

Ace is moving messy. It‚Äôs juuust at the edge of remaining entertaining.

Chelley didn‚Äôt stand for Charlie because she‚Äôs recoupling with Ace. Hope she doesn‚Äôt mind him going hard for Huda.

Speaking of Huda, it really is becoming a Chekov‚Äôs Child situation. I would say she should take all the time she‚Äôs needs but if she‚Äôs going to escalate things physically and emotionally it‚Äôs only fair to be open with her partner about a large part of her identity.

Jeremiah didn‚Äôt lose any red flags with his concern about Huda potentially lying but I did find it cute he wanted them to match. 

I actually really like Charlie but don‚Äôt think his person is there. Bell-A should have stood up and gave it a shot.

Nic the feral nurse found someone that matches his freak and he‚Äôll pretend to watch whatever show she wants. Cierra is going to be a star and I loved her talk with Chelley.

Austin was there too.

"Ahh yes Jeremiah the cheater and Huda the secret mother. Great combo, this can't possibly lead to anything toxic.
When Huda finds out that her ""baby"" Jeremiah is a reformed cheater she's going to loose it. That cancels out every part of the holier than thou image she has of him and the image she is trying to create of their relationship so far. I could go on about her withholding being a mother until someone is fully invested in her... insane. Toxic IMO
When Jeremiah finds out she's a mother he's going to run... internally... but he will save face for a redemption arc because he knows he's on national television and getting through and staying together could give him support, followers, and ultimately the win.

Just to put things into perspective

Jeremiah/Huda are the most popular pairing (makes sense for now)

Chelley will carry whoever she couples up with

The audience has to get to know Cierra more but first bombshells never poll well Nic is well liked so she'll be safe if they stay coupled

Taylor/Olandria could make up ground. Taylor is popular amongst guys. I know some want a bombshell for Olandria but that polling might not fair well with this cast make up",14,1749100208.0,Eatmyshorts43,1l3o4md,Season 7 - Episode 2 - Post Episode Discussion

"Not sure what the consensus is yet, but I think the producers nailed this first fire pit bombshell coupling. I feel bad because they even got Taylor to slip up, but I don‚Äôt think he fully understood what his actions were saying when he stood up.

The first real test for the islanders was the producers sending the texts instead of Ariana hosting the first fire pit. Olandria read the text, which also prefaced the upcoming choice by saying this decision is based on whether you‚Äôre happy in your current couple or not. The wording is sneaky, and I think the tension of the fire pit could likely cause some of them to not really register that part fully. 

Taylor and Olandria had a really good chat at Soul Ties during the day; she was honest about wanting to take a chance and kiss Ace, and Taylor seemed to completely understand and agree that exploring other connections is the best way to find the right partner for yourself.

To me, I could see him having that same mindset when he decided to stand up at the fire pit. I don‚Äôt think he realized or registered that he was essentially saying he was not happy being coupled up with Olandria when he stood up. Olandria probably paid the most attention to how this was worded since she was the one reading the text to the group.

Well I‚Äôm still liking the Olandria and Taylor coupling; I feel like even though both have shown interest to other people they always find time to be honest with each other. Honestly I‚Äôm liking them with each episode. Go double Geminis ‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è

I honestly think Nicolas had better chemistry with Cierra than he‚Äôs had with Belle-A. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt become a mess with the 50/50 he perceives is going in his head; there‚Äôs definitely potential with this new couple. But I also hope Belle-A can find someone else to pursue (maybe Charlie or another male bombshell?)

Huda and Jeremiah. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but something feels off with this couple. I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre too scared to try to pursue other connections under the veil of ‚Äúbeing locked in with each other‚Äù. Also, why hasn‚Äôt Huda disclosed to the men about her child‚Ä¶?

Austin, Shelley, Ace, Charlie - I‚Äôm surprised Shelley didn‚Äôt stand up for the recoupling with Charlie, but maybe she might be more into Ace than the other guys. We‚Äôll see at next recoupling - honestly Charlie and Austin should try to pursue Belle-A; either of them could be a better fit for her instead of Nic

I‚Äôm definitely still interested in this season; can‚Äôt wait for next episode",8,1749095515.0,Complete_Wish_3246,1l3o4md,Season 7 - Episode 2 - Post Episode Discussion

It‚Äôs like when you see a gun get revealed somehow in a movie or tv show - it should be relevant again at some point in the story.  Like you shouldn‚Äôt just introduce a gun in a shot just for it to never come up again. So then as viewers we wait to see when that gun pops up again.  You might even forget about it until the character randomly whips it out again at the end.  But once we know the gun is there were waiting for it to come out and sometimes can only think about that reveal.  With Huda‚Äôs baby - we are now in the waiting era.  There is no world where we get through the rest of the season without the men of the show finding out about the baby.  We know about it and thus it must come out.  And the longer Huda delays it the more likely the producers manipulate things for that to happen anyways.,18,1749144793.0,AllStarSpecial10001,1l3o4md,Season 7 - Episode 2 - Post Episode Discussion

No I agree with you. I‚Äôm talking specially about the comments saying he‚Äôs gonna leave her!  like they‚Äôre waiting and rooting for it to happen to she can get her ‚Äúlick back‚Äù is weird and rooted in misogyny IMO,5,1749098814.0,maiinmay,1l3o4md,Season 7 - Episode 2 - Post Episode Discussion

"It just sounds like we just took different things from the conversation which is ok.

"my usage of ""isnt that young"" was to suggest that she's old enough to not have tiktok brainrot in her lexicon if she chose not to.

I don‚Äôt mean to say he‚Äôs gonna stay. He seems off to me too. I‚Äôm just saying the way people in the threads commenting stuff like ‚Äújust wait until he finds out she has a kid‚Äù or ‚Äútell him you have a kid now‚Äù is very misogynistic. It‚Äôs insinuating that most men would leave her. Why would a man not stay with her? Because she‚Äôs a single mom? Why are we rooting for a woman to be dropped by a man so bad like it‚Äôs weird lol.,2,1749097092.0,maiinmay,1l3o4md,Season 7 - Episode 2 - Post Episode Discussion
