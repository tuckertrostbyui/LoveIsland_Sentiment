"Re. Jeremiah mentioning winning - numerous past Islanders have said that people *do* talk about the game, winning, IG followers etc in the villa. It rarely makes the edit because it breaks the the fourth wall. For Jeremiah’s comment to be included in an episode, either he’s gameplaying so blatantly they can’t ignore it (as with Jake in UK S7) or the producers don’t like him that much. Either way I don’t think the producers are pushing him to win!",84,1749381014.0,buffys_sushi_pjs,1l613tj,Season 7 - Episode 5 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion

Idk if im crazy but people are mad at the new bombshell for going for Ace but we wanted her to shake things up especially with Jeremiah so why is it a problem now? 😭 unless it gets Chelley kicked off but it’s not that deep I feel like for now…and if it just makes Ace graduate towards Chelley even more that’ll solidify them imo,48,1749354764.0,Jazzlike-Hall7987,1l613tj,Season 7 - Episode 5 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion

"The After Sun made me like Olandria even more! She was already in my top 3 and she hasn’t necessarily moved up spots but I really enjoyed her.

I also like that she admitted she and Taylor make sense on paper but don’t seem to have that romantic spark yet. I like them both and they could potentially get there but I’ve seen a more platonic relationship so far.

Sidenotes: Wait, there’s only been 4 weddings in ALL of the Love Island universe? Those are terrible stats 😂

"My summary:
- Sophie Monk is made for this. Ten times better than Maura.
- Olandria is the best islander so far.
- Ariana’s job is to shit on the guys. Can’t believe she called Jeremiah possessive and at the same time did not mention the shit Huda did and never called her out. And she said it clearly I normally don’t cover especially if it is a guy. As a host she shouldn’t be there to take gender sides.
- Callum and Cely are amazing guests, I don’t feel Jess.
- the two new bombshells are annoying and immature",73,1749349575.0,Few_Tip3307,1l613tj,Season 7 - Episode 5 Aftersun 🔆 - Post Episode Discussion

"That’s just kinda Leah anytime she’s doing something that’s scripted. If she’s not just being herself it comes off stiff. Same with the Dunkin commercial and even with her heart race challenge when she was doing all the one liners last season. It worked there cuz her whole thing was over the top/tongue in cheek but she brings that same kinda energy anytime she’s acting.

I will say tho that I thought she was more awkward in the 1st one I saw, the 2nd commercial I saw today I thought she seemed more natural.

But to be fair none of them are actors and they all kinda put on an “I’m acting right now” delivery with scripted work - Leah’s just the most blatant then maybe JaNa. I agree with OP, Kaylor has the best delivery in these set of commercials. I’ve seen certain IG ads from her tho in the past that were a lil stiff too.
