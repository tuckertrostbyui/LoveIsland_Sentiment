"Genuinely left this episode feeling sad and sick at what we are watching. I have been waiting and watching before drawing strong opinions on either Jeremiah or Huda, but after this I feel pretty set. I see some potentially toxic traits in him but I really haven‚Äôt seen it be so overwhelming like some people are suggesting, and after this episode I‚Äôm keeping even more of an open mind with him. 

Huda on the other hand clearly has serious anxious attachment issues (and girl i get it), but she needs therapy and this show isn‚Äôt doing her any good. Every episode it seems like she forgot what she signed up for with how hard she‚Äôs going after Jeremiah for doing the basics of the show (challenge kisses, sharing the bed, pulling girls for chats). I don‚Äôt feel good about what this is (and will continue) doing to her mentally. 

Finally, I felt so, so bad for Jalen. I understand Olandria‚Äôs connection with Taylor is stronger and can respect that. However, I feel that Jalen came in with respectful and mature energy and didn‚Äôt deserve to go out the way he did. The fact that SO many of the islanders stood behind Huda after calling out her toxic behavior to her face or talking amongst themselves about how bad it‚Äôs harming the villa dynamic was really concerning.

Taylor went to her side because of Jalen, and also to follow Olandria.

The girls need to break to get her off the show.  They had their chance last night.  Cierra going to Jalen‚Äôs side in the beginning would‚Äôve likely had one more girl (O or Chelley).

"I want better options for Chelley and Olandria than Ace and Taylor. Ace has Chelley on the back burner‚Äî a backup/second choice to fall back on. That‚Äôs not a solid foundation for love.

I know we‚Äôre only two weeks in but I just don‚Äôt get serious vibes from them as a couple. They play too coy and at first, that can be fun, but it gets exhausting and old real quick.

I think Olandria thinks Taylor is way more into her than he actually is. I think Olandria‚Äôs physical boundaries is THE perfect excuse for him to get away with not wanting to be physical. Even when she brought up that he could do more he gave her a lame ass kiss that placated her (unfortunately.) I think she deserves someone who is intellectually stimulating but genuinely interested in her. In one of the earlier episodes she said they always talk about everyone else when they‚Äôre together and rarely talk about themselves‚Ä¶ if you genuinely liked someone, wouldn‚Äôt you want to get to know them more?

I feel so bad for iris esp the comment about her being the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù choice she seems incredibly mature and i feel that she felt forced to vote with huda otherwise she risked being ostracized from the girls. I agree that taylor/ace votes seemed to get rid of jalen as competition but olandria picked taylor so jalen should‚Äôve got a chance to find his love. Insane they were trying to say huda deserved to find love but jalen didn‚Äôt. All the girls who enable her deserve the shit storm; how are you gonna recognize the toxicity and still vote for it - every comment about it being friendship island is right.

And I truly think Iris only saved her to be on her good side. Ima need these other islanders to stop saving her, not bc of her toxic relationship with that light skin but bc she‚Äôs so FAKE. Like get her ass off my screen pls. Anyways ima still tune in tmr ü§£

"I noticed that huda just keeps lying against Jeremiah what‚Äôs up with that? The first time was when she was eavesdropping on the boys conversation and told the girls he wanted to make Iris his ‚Äúescape goat‚Äù so he could win or something like that.

On last nights episode she told the group that he said he didn‚Äôt care to make her like him. That is false. And she knows this cause even when she said to Jeremiah, ‚Äúyou just said you don‚Äôt care to make me like you‚Äù he tried to correct her and was like that wasn‚Äôt what I said. But still she ran with that. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make you like me‚Äù in response to her saying he thinks them working on their friendship is his way of making her like him.

I understand that she‚Äôs upset but actively twisting his words to fit her narrative when we‚Äôre all watching and know what he ACTUALLY said. I just can‚Äôt

P.S - I also think his suggestion of focusing on their friendship was very reasonable especially considering everything that had happened in the past day. I think the real issue is that she didn‚Äôt wanna hear it/just wants everything to go back to how it was before. I also think she constantly disrespects him with all the name calling and making him look small in front of the group.

"I have empathy for Huda in my heart, I really do- I don't think she is well and I really want her to get better. I bet there are lots of good qualities about her that we aren't seeing.

But wtf why they voted to save her is beyond me- she needs to get out of the villa. It isn't fun to watch the breakdowns and the name calling. The islanders seem tired of her too, like ??? Jalen seemed kind and I think he would have had more chances to find connections. I don't see that same path for Huda, and on top of the way she is treating people, I just don't understand why she is still going to be around. 

I won't pretend that I'm not going to keep watching but please let us at least see more of the other islanders and less of the Huda show if she's going to stay around.

I know Jeremiah isn't innocent in the way their relationship went, but I am curious/excited to see if he has experienced some growth from this experience so far and how he could be in future connections/relationships. Not convinced him and Iris are going to work out at all but maybe with someone else.

Otherwise the girls stand with the girls and boys with the boys (except Ace who stands for maybe Taylor, more drama, hatred of Jeremiah, some sort of allegiance to Huda even though he voted for her off the night before). 

Soooo happy the Chelley/Ace/Austin triangle is done!! That storyline was draggggging particularly because it was obvious Chelley would end up with Ace. Excited to see if anything will develop between Amaya and Austin as I find them cute together.

I think Austin was just spitballing as he does, but it was unfair of him to call Iris the safe option for Jeremiah, that was rude.

Huda and Jeremiah‚Äôs dynamic reminds me a lot the couples we‚Äôd seen on reality tv in the 2000s like it is raw, intense, unhealthy and heavy. And it‚Äôs draining the life out of everyone Nic was on point this episode. And 
Good on Jeremiah for choosing Iris over Huda, my jaw was on the floor I expected him to go back to her I just hope this means they are done for good. 

Even if Olandria had more time to explore with Jalen she was still always going to pick Taylor because that‚Äôs who she‚Äôs been with the longest even tho I don‚Äôt agree with her choice.

Unpopular opinion but I understand why the women saved Huda. She offically got rejected by the man shes been with since day 1 (even if it was deserved) and America voted against her just 2 days ago and she knows the country hates her. To have your friends also turn on you is just too brutal. She‚Äôs been driving them insane and making everyone miserable but she is still a human being and their friend.

"my final thoughts on them keeping Huda. production knows what it would take to get her out and at this point that‚Äôs an automatic dumping. the reason they‚Äôre not doing that is because they still want her in there and for reasons already stated the girls aren‚Äôt letting her go just yet. 

this happens almost every season. the formula is very clear. when they want someone out they make that shit quick (anybody remember Sereniti? & the mass dumping in S5???) 

when they don‚Äôt, they drag it out (as seen with Rob, Kaylor/Aaron, Bergie, Liv, the JaNa vote, and the Destiny votes where it was up to the islanders.) 

Whether it‚Äôs for better or worse they make a way to keep the folks they want in. & whether we want to accept it or not these people are spending 24/7 with each other. despite Huda‚Äôs actions they still seem to care for her and from the preview it looks like they‚Äôre giving her this chance out of that care for her. So, we shall see. Idk I‚Äôm okay with the outcome tbh. This didn‚Äôt go how I expected but now we‚Äôve opened the door for new storylines and people had no choice but to make a decision and officially stand in it.",20,1750218681.0,hopepeacelove1,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

She's verbally bashed Iris twice in two separate situations, when she's been nothing but nice and pleasant.

Enough with the ""girl power"". Too much of a good thing always turns into a bad thing, and standing beside Huda is wild. Iris almost had no choice but to choose Huda, lest she be outcasted by the others. 

Ace and Taylor would rather keep a storm cloud over the villa just to vote Jalen (competition) out (if that rumor is to be believed). That makes me mad because if Olandria ended up having a better connection with Jalen, then that's her decision to make.

1) Only after she heard that Jeremiah didn't think she was his type and that he wasn't attracted to her. It changed her perspective about Jeremiah and she wanted to make a point that she's not specifically going after him either.

2) If she had voted against Huda, it may have been misinterpreted that she came for her man (who seemed so closed off in his couple when she came in) and now voting Huda out would only confirm it, which makes her not a girl's girl.

However, when Olandria (somewhat jokingly, somewhat seriously) asked her what her dealbreakers are and she said she didn‚Äôt want to discuss it now and would talk about it later‚Ä¶?

Ace probably voted the way he did because of the Taylor/Jalen situation with olandria. Don‚Äôt agree with it but I‚Äôm feeling that‚Äôs why.

"My best interpretation of the votes is that this is production. Bc Ace voting to save Huda and in the same breath saying ""fuck no"" to her after she thanked him? What else could that possibly mean???


Literally the core six were sitting together and clowning her just 10 hours earlier. It wasn't even disguised. They all DESPISE her. They were shaking hands w Jeremiah and hyping him up about Iris. Iris HERSELF said she picked Jeremiah to SAVE him from Huda then votes to keep her on? MINUTES after Huda insulted her? To vote out her bombshell bestie???


None of it makes sense. Idc if you think Ace is a scammer. Or if the girls r all actually Huda'a friends. What happened does not line up AT all with what we heard earlier in the episode. This reeks of producer interference.¬†


They think we wanna keep tuning in for Huda. But actually, we've been tuning in bc we assumed she'd be humbled and LEAVE. If they keep dragging her along for the plot people r gonna drop the show.

i am not interested in seeing huda explore any other connections. someone does not go from this level of toxicity to healed overnight. any connection she makes will lead to the same situation. please get her off the villa because she triggers my fight or flight",25,1750226629.0,Nightstar14,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

At the end of the day, the producers need to put out a show that‚Äôs buzzworthy & will create engagement across all platforms. Every viral moment thus far has been primarily Huda/Jeremiah. 

The only other thing I can think of is this Nicolandria crackship which hasn‚Äôt even happened on the show. People are so bored they‚Äôre creating their own storylines.

Ace is annoying tf out of me.

Hannah walks towards them and Ace is still going. When Pepe sees her, he books it as if he was looking for an out. That recoupling inflated Ace's already inflated ego. He kept lecturing everyone that America agrees with him that Jeremiah is fake and scamming. ....that's not why bud. Iris is the only one who seems to know why the voting went the way it did. She seems sweet. Every Ace date is breakfast with the boys. If Chelley hasn't walked away by now, she likes his bullshit obviously. I thought she was better than that.


I'm happy for Amaya and Austin. Amaya is the non-toxic version of Huda.

"I really hope Iris doesn‚Äôt let Huda get into her head. I‚Äôve seen this time and time again with toxic couples.

One of the people in the couple realizes it‚Äôs toxicity and they try to branch out to find someone new, but is still stuck in the cycle. They confide in their toxic partner that everything with the new coupling isn‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows - because they‚Äôre confused since normal relationships don‚Äôt begin with unhealthy love bombing. 
The other toxic partner then uses that for leverage to break down the new person in the couple - which makes them doubt everything about their connection with the other person and usually scares them off. The toxic relationship continues then because person who tried to leave then feels isolated and usually falls back into the cycle. 

I really hope Iris doesn‚Äôt get too wrapped up in all of that and just focuses on furthering her connection with Jeremiah. We‚Äôll see next episode though.

Jeremiah isn‚Äôt wrong for saying that Iris isn‚Äôt his type, but he‚Äôs clearly shallow. - but I‚Äôll let it pass personally, because sometimes when you build a connection that‚Äôs not just based in appearances that‚Äôs when you meet your true match.

What do you think the reasoning is for it? Is this cast more buttoned up? Are certain people making others uncomfortable and unable to open up and be themselves?

Get rid of the instigators and let everyone else find their own way. I will probably get downvoted but Ace imo is as bad as Huda just in a different way.

I think that he will try to turn Iris against Jeremiah using Huda‚Äôs words against him. He did want Huda but not any more because he knows that they did the deed.

"
Huda needed to go home. Her toxicity aside, she NEEDS to seek mental treatment ASAP. She was having a full blown panic attack when talking to Hannah after Jeremiah pulled the chair for Iris. She is spiraling. It‚Äôs cruel to keep her on at this point. This is why ppl have unalived themselves after being on here. She is not mentally stable to be on any longer! 

Iris felt obligated to vote for Huda bc she was already winning the votes and didn‚Äôt want anymore problems. Which, makes zero sense. But that‚Äôs the only reason I can think of. She came in with Jalen! She knows he is an amazing guy who DESERVES to find love.

Ace voted to save Huda just bc of Taylor. I love how he was just talking smack about Austin‚Äôs vote, but when HE does it. It‚Äôs all good. He thinks he‚Äôs the king of the villa. He hates Jeremiah. I can feel it when he looks at him. He cannot stand him. Maybe bc Jeremiah is the best looking. Idk ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Olandria and Taylor not voting to save Jalen, made me sad. I can understand Taylor maybe, bc obvs he‚Äôs competition, but Olandria, knowing how kind and respectful Jalen was, was a slap to the face! Two slaps actually.

TLDR;  THIS VOTING MAKES ZERO SENSE. 

Huda will not explore other connections. She will continue to make everyone‚Äôs time there a living hell. 

Jalen on the other hand, was open and deserving of his spot in the island to continue to find a connection. 

Iris voting against Jalen, was so sad to watch.

"A few reasons Ace might have voted for her: 
1) He hates Jeremiah and doesn‚Äôt want him to see peace. 
2) He wants to get with Huda & now will start trying to form a connection with her (which will make Chelley jealous which I also think he likes doing).
3) He knows Huda and Jeremiah in the villa will cause inevitable chaos. Whether they get back together or not, there will no doubt be drama which means people will be watching. Given Ace‚Äôs social media career, he might be thinking about ways to keep things interesting for viewers. 

If Huda makes it to movie night & they show multiple people calling her ‚ÄúHurricane Huda‚Äù & her girlfriends talking about how they‚Äôre over the drama & won‚Äôt save her again, I‚Äôm sure she will go scorched earth.",12,1750215867.0,BellaGothsLovechild,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

Also the discourse about Iris being a pick me or not a girls girl.. this really proves that she IS a girls girl because if I was her and Huda said ‚ÄùShe‚Äôs not even his type‚Äù about me? I would‚Äôve voted her off soooo quickly because that was clearly a dig at Iris.

Anyway, I feel so bad for Jaylen, he seems so kind he deserved to stay and explore other options. Olandria should‚Äôve picked him in my opinion, Taylor does not seem that interested in Olandria.

"I wonder what production is trying to do with Huda?

We get a re-coupling 2 days later? That already seems fishy. But Ariana seemed genuinely surprised at the outcome here. My guess is they were anticipating a Taylor/Huda vote-off in which Taylor wins.

I think they tried to get rid of Huda as cleanly as possible. They couldn‚Äôt eliminate the un-coupled person, because there was an equal number of men and women left.

Production always seems very apprehensive about pulling people from the show unilaterally (I imagine especially after Yulissa), but they‚Äôre at E13 where i think they want Huda gone so they can get back to basics and give other couples more screen time before Casa.

Nic and Cierra win 

Austin and Amaya make it until the end

Taylor and olandria are that couple that makes it to the end that everyone knows won‚Äôt last

"Miniscule defence for the cast:

They did not see the conversation with Huda and Jeremiah yesterday, they also haven't seen all of the little tiny arguments and conversations, & in the moment interviews leading up to this. They JUST that morning were coming to the conclusion that this situation is toxic, something we have known for about a week. Huda even said, we don't tell people our issues. So like... How much of it do they know? 

I think tonight's thought process was, ""well, he said that they're done, he's moving on & she's already been hurt a lot tonight. Let's not pour salt into the wound and vote her out. *Surely* she will get her shit together and accept this (because that's what a normal, well adjusted women would do)"". 

Obviously that is not going to happen because she is UNWELL but we are the ones with all of that context and evidence of 500 mini tantrums she's thrown to know that she doesn't get over anything!! They have seen a day of a major temper tantrum and maybe some tiny inklings of stuff.",18,1750223938.0,brashumpire,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

He is not attracted to Olandria at all and treats her like his meal ticket to staying on the island because none of the other gurls are interested in him. He only likes white women, hes one of those. And Ace clocked that he is going to get booted if he doesnt step it up. 

If Olandria chose Jaylyn it would have come down to Taylor and Huda and every single guy would have stood behind Taylor and at least ONE girl would have stood behind Taylor in a heartbeat because hes literally the gay best friend of the island with the girls. The reason Huda won is because Ace wasn‚Äôt anticipating it coming down to Jaylyn and Huda and he had to stand behind Huda because hes loyal to Taylor and knows if Jaylyn stays it would be a huge threat to Taylor because the more time Olandria spends with Jaylyn shed eventually realize what a loser Taylor is.

On the other hand, Jeremiah just keeps to himself, I presume as a way to save face for Huda (I‚Äôve seen a lot of men with this passive approach). I think if Jeremiah would actually go out there and start talking about his side, the cast would realize Huda has been manipulating all of them. That‚Äôs what led to all this fucked up voting.

Idk, it just seemed weird to me cause in the end she wasn‚Äôt going to choose Austin anyways. But I bet that gave him closure and also relief that the triangle is finally over.

there isn't much love on love island rn, like i lowkey forgot what show we're supposed to be watching :(

"What on earth are we missing? Why did Taylor and Ace side with Huda? I am BAAAAFFFFLED?!? Is Ace just playing a producers game here? does he know that Huda is making for ""great TV"" and keeping her on for ratings because he is with Chelley and would know she is a fan fav? I feel like he's ten steps ahead of everyone, and as cute as a button as he is, he is deffo playing the game here. He knew heading to chelley from the start wouldn't be wise, he mentioned so multiple times to the others that did MAINLY huda and Jeremiah, so he took his time with Chelley... now he's keeping Huda in even though AMERICA (i'm not america, FYI but I can't vote from Australia) can see that she is mentally not well. I don't know. Make it make sense. There's nothing in Love Island for Huda. Jeremiah has tapped out, and rightfully so. The whole cast is absolutely SICK TO DEATH of it, and yet voted her in. I don't know. is it out of fear???????? Were the girls all scared of her and the backlash that may have come if they didnt side with her? Which brings me to the full circle moment that Huda's mental health and anger issues are NOT OK and not okay to be weaponized all over television. I worry for her and everyone else in there, and I worry for her and her family when she gets out. I love the show so much, but something ain't right.

I did just read something interesting on another reddit post: producers made Ace side with Huda - which would make sense when she went to shake his hand and thank him and he said ""hell no"" and pulled away.

"Anyone else get the vibe Nic is playing to the camera. To me, he seems to be very aware of America & caught on quick what it meant when Jeremiah & Iris were coupled up by the public.

He also told Austin that his vote for Taylor sent his best friend, Charlie, home. He‚Äôs a nurse, which is something you have to really study and work hard to achieve. He‚Äôs playing up this himbo/dumb model personality. He‚Äôs a lot smarter than he gives off.

Some of the game play I think he did: He got in Jeremiah‚Äôs head about Huda being ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù but wanted to make sure it didn‚Äôt get back to him by saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell her.‚Äù After Huda shared with him about being a mom, he was saying all these nice things about her in his confessional, probably cuz he thought that‚Äôs what America would want to hear. He quickly switched back to ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù after the public vote. He then switched up & defended Huda to Jeremiah about not being a ‚Äúman‚Äù for her, cuz he realized the possibility that Jeremiah might be who America dislikes. I don‚Äôt know.

"ACE AND CHELLEY 

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of rumours about Chelley and Ace scamming - and many people are theorizing that these two have been dating outside of the show for a while and are orchestrating their win.

I kinda of agree with this and have crafted my own theory. THIS IS JUST A THEORY IM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE OF ANYTHING

I think that Ace and Chelley have been in a relationship prior to the show. I think Ace was approached by the LI team because he‚Äôs a well-known influencer with multiple TV appearances. After his casting, he may have convinced Chelley to apply as well - considering she is a model herself with industry connections through starring in music videos etc. Once both of them were officially casted, they came up with the plan to create a slow burn ‚Äúwill they won‚Äôt they‚Äù arc between them, purposefully creating obstacles between their connection (Yulissa, Amaya, Austin) in order to make their story look more realistic to audiences. They have seen how audiences loved Serena and Kordell‚Äôs ‚Äúalways going back to each other‚Äù plotline that people loved, and wanted to create their own plotline. In order to not get caught by the production team, they made it known that they did in fact know eachother outside the villa, however they lied about the EXTENT to which they know eachother (saying they only met once outside of a club). This would also explain why they‚Äôve only kissed eachother outside of challenges and why Ace did not want to be physically affectionate to Amaya. FURTHERMORE, this also explains why Ace was especially triggered at Jeremiah and Huda for being extremely closed off and calling them ‚Äúscammers‚Äù, because he sees right through their act - house made of glass. This ALSO explains why Chelley and Austin‚Äôs conversations really lack any substance and she keeps saying ‚ÄúI still like Austin‚Äù but it‚Äôs more than obvious that she‚Äôs phoning it in. Also when Austin gets frustrated during his confessional and says that if Ace knows what he wants he should just go for it - it‚Äôs because Ace is purposely creating obstacles between them for the storyline. We gotta understand that Ace has a lot of knowledge about the entertainment industry and being on TV in general - he knows what the audience wants and he has a plan to win everyone over. You may also think that it would be impossible for the LI team to have missed this while doing their research‚Ä¶are we forgetting that they completely missed Yulissa using slurs?? And the only reason she got caught was because of the audience exposing her.

TLDR; Chelley and Ace have BEEN in a relationship, orchestrated a slow-burn/invisible string theory plotline, and are smarter than we think.",5,1750278102.0,Sensitive_Beat_9655,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

"
Alright so ive been thinking a bit after tonight's episode and I wanted to say something ive noticed.

Women on reality TV have always been villainized for even breathing wrong. So now, a lot of the Love Island girls play it safe to avoid being labeled a bully, mean girl, or fake feminist by the public. This season, you can feel how much they're curating their behavior for the camera and for TikTok thinkpieces.(Not just the girls but the boys as well)

Yulissa literally got kicked off because of her digital footprint. Sometimes islanders have Their IRL friends are running their pages. These girls are aware of the long-term consequences of every move they make, and it‚Äôs shaping their gameplay in a big way.

Tonight‚Äôs recoupling was the perfect example. The girls saved Huda under the guise of ‚Äúsolidarity,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt come off as real support. It felt like fear of Huda‚Äôs reaction and of how America would react if they didn‚Äôt save her. And I think deep down, Iris and Olandaria wanted to vote her off. But they knew the internet would eat them alive if they did.

This reminds me of Season 6 when Andrea and the Casa girls were treated like garbage. The girls now have clearly learned from that edit and are scared of repeating it.

And let‚Äôs talk Ace real quick: he could have voted Huda just to knock out Taylor‚Äôs competition. But honestly, if Jalen stayed, he probably would've explored things with Amaya or Chelly, maybe it's a reach.

Production wanted Huda gone, let‚Äôs be real. They saw the storm coming. The girls blocked it and now they‚Äôre going to catch the full force.

At least Jalen got a free vacation üíÄ

If the girls *really* wanted to be ‚Äúgirls‚Äô girls,‚Äù they would've sat Huda down, told her with love, ‚Äúit's time to go,‚Äù and moved on. Because real sisterhood isn‚Äôt performative..it‚Äôs accountability.

TL;DR:
The girls saving Huda tonight wasn‚Äôt a genuine act of solidarity;it was damage control. This season is being shaped by digital footprint anxiety and fear of public backlash. Iris and Olandaria likely wanted her gone, but didn‚Äôt want to deal with the internet's wrath. The ‚Äúgirls‚Äô girl‚Äù narrative is becoming so performative that it‚Äôs ruining the show‚Äôs authenticity.",2,1750223779.0,Top-Willingness-3452,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

"I honestly think Jeremiah is manipulative af and both Iris and Huda deserve better. Huda is definitely extremely toxic, but her reactions seem to be coming from (possible) trauma in previous relationships - not that it excuses any of her behaviors. I do think Jeremiah was leading her on in a way. Moving like a whole ass couple not even 2 days in!! He isn‚Äôt considerate of her feelings at all. Also him spraying cologne on her bed is insane, idc.

On the flip side, I also acknowledge that the level headed shit he says seems to trigger her and she spirals. None of this excuses the way she treats the other girls though. Cierra was right to call her out on the name-calling. This really isn‚Äôt the show for Huda, it‚Äôs about time she goes home.

I HATED the way Huda humiliated Iris in front of the entire cast and the fact that she only apologizes to people she berates once they do something for her is really telling.

I hope post-show she‚Äôll be able to seek therapy and work on her self-esteem because she deserves better than that. It‚Äôs exhausting for both herself and the people around her.

"The response to this season has been so interesting... for years now watching reality TV i have felt a level of toxicity in being a ""girls girl"" that leans towards misandry. And like I'm not up in arms about it, because I think that's an understandable reaction to misogyny and a natural part of extricating yourself from an oppressive system, but it has still been frustrating to watch everyone on screen and online not seem to notice what I was noticing about how women on TV frequently don't hold each other any more accountable than the men do, which does get called out often.

It's even something I've noticed in real life, where I've been sort of rejected by friend groups with girls because I'm not willing to do the whole ""you're always right"" thing.

I feel like Huda is a lightning rod for really displaying this issue. She's so obviously wrong and so obviously toxic that it's impossible to ignore the lack of accountability from the girls. I wonder if this will start a shift in reality TV or if it's just a one time occurrence. 

I do think we should give the girls grace though! First off, most of them are very young, and secondly, I understand their dynamic. It's frustrating and unhealthy, but I understand it.",6,1750264770.0,BobSagetsBluntSlut,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

After reading some comments I think she did it to get Huda off her back. Like I saved you so leave me alone kind of bullshit. Iris could have easily stooped to Huda‚Äôs level and saved Jalen (I wish she did) now Huda can‚Äôt walk around the villa cussing and calling Iris names because Iris showed kindness and compassion towards her even after Huda stood there and tried to embarrass Iris and calling her last choice or whatever or not good enough safest option type shit. I think all the other girls are clowning because so they really think just because they saved Huda that she‚Äôs all of a sudden gonna act differently? The moment something happens between Iris and Jeremiah or whatever she‚Äôs gonna lose it. Also no incoming bombshell is gonna wanna fuck with Huda if they know what‚Äôs best for them.

"I think that removes her own culpability in her actions.

"Of course i 100% agree, but i think her delusions and needs are fed by the motivation to find a father for her kid, so thats whats lighting the fire in the first place. And of course i dont mean love she just wants reassurance that he wants her, i just said it wrong. In the real world she probably doesnt have to see a guy kissing or talking with other women, and maybe the father cheated on her so much which is why she has this baggage of trauma that shes been thru cuz it takes a lot to create someone with this bad of a mental state. I just dont think she was ever ready to be on this show given her situation and maybe the producers thought they could help and find her a true father? But hopefully the islanders start checking her energy because nobody has found the words to say stop, calm down they just feed into all her dramatics.

"The Housewives shows are different because they are straight salary.  Those shows are one step away from being fully scripted.  But here, with a cash prize going to the winners, they can manipulate/suggest dialogue, even suggest/encourage coupling, but they can't dictate actual ""dumping"" votes without risking lawsuits.

But I agree that tonight was ""interesting.""  I saw production's hand in some of the scenes, but overall I think production was as surprised by the final outcome as we were. 

Tonight was designed to get Huda out because, despite helping deliver blockbuster numbers, she has also become a potential liability. When she pulled Iris after the triple date and Pepe and Jalen were concerned about leaving Iris alone with her, the lawyer in me was SCREAMING ""potential liability"".  Huda has exhibited enough volatility and emotional instability that if anything happens (ex: if she physically attacks a castmate), production can't argue that they were unaware of the PROBABILITY that such an attack would occur.  She has been an unrelenting walking, creeping, screaming, skulking red flag for several days. 

I GUARANTEE you their on-set psychologist is checking in with her daily, as well as getting feedback from the other contestants on their mental health, which explains the repeated talking heads last night with everyone mentioning how drained they were by the whole H & J mess (plus Ian's hilarious commentary about how long they had been arguingüòÇ).

Production wanted her out, and they thought she WOULD be out.  But there is no accounting for the actions of 20-something year-olds.  Logic is not always a part of their modus operandi, but social media acceptance and groupthink are.  Once Cierra walked behind Huda, it was a done deal.  I knew every single girl would follow suit, but I didn't expect Ace to do so as well (always scheming).  What we saw was a bunch of young girls who didn't want the public to see them as ""not supportive"" of another woman -- no matter how batshit crazy and just plain MEAN that woman happens to be.  But their support has only emboldened Huda to be even more vindictive because she now thinks she's untouchable.

"Which is a solid point. The ""love bombing"" debate has been going on for a while. From my perspective, I thought, ""well why cant they just be happy?"" A strong couple to emerge from the first day isn't new to Love Island. Multiple seasons have seen a day one couple reach the finals with their issues of casa breakups or just arguing and getting back together.


Olandria's and others comments make me feel that they just didn't see them as a couple. Whether in levels of attractiveness or just thinking opposites dont attract, they weren't into it and chose to think, ""this just feels weird.""


I think Jeremiah definitely liked¬† Huda but as he got to know her maybe he thought he was in over his head. and maybe his change in demeanor and body language was a catalyst to a bit of paranoia, ""would you share with me your location?"" Jeremiah was trying to stay present with new information of her being a mom but Huda wasn't convinced.

"This is incredibly misogynistic and factually incorrect. If you are a woman (I assume you are with the name Huda) you should be ashamed of yourself for speaking poorly about YOURSELF. 

How men and women control and display their emotions is based on experience, personality, emotional intelligence, mental health, etc. many factors, not just their dick versus tits.

Do women cry more than men? Usually, yes. This does NOT mean women cannot CONTROL their emotions worse than men. 

And if you think I am wrong then ask yourself this basic question: globally, how many shootings are men versus women? How many serial killers are men versus women? How many murderers are men versus women? Those are all EMOTIONALLY charged situations and if you think men can control their emotions better than women then think how that could possibly be true with the amount of violence men display.

"I'm just trying to brainstorm to figure out why she must've done that, fully possible that she did that, but I also feel like there's a huge likelihood that she stood behind huda because she knew huda was going to stay at that point because more people stood behind her and she just didn't want the drama from huda if she did stay.

"see but like you don‚Äôt get it either‚Ä¶ like the pancakes‚Ä¶. look at the bigger picture of it. she asked him to do cuter things for her, and all the girls get eggs, bacon and pancakes‚Ä¶ and he brought her a raw one. it probs hurt her feelings and she is too insecure in herself and didn‚Äôt want to bruise her ego so she tried to make him feel bad by having taylor make her the new pancakes‚Ä¶. do you understand why she is upset to start here???

 also, i feel like bringing up the pancakes is also just expanding on the idea of not seeing where she is coming from.",2,1750214497.0,One-University5008,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion
I‚Äôm 30 and it‚Äôs not that deep for me that‚Äôs it is to u to call me base of one comment how I am honestly I don‚Äôt believe in misogyny/feminisim I do believe in two genders women/ men and I do believe we‚Äôre different and how should we handle our emotions and I do believe that we are the way we are because of those activism acts it makes no sense I do believe a man should be raised different that a female I like it the old ways and that‚Äôs ok u have ur own opinions and I respect it but I don‚Äôt like that u are very defensive that u put judgement on me it‚Äôs ok to be different as long as we are not hurting each other good luck,1,1750281594.0,More_Art5129,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

"wait r u talking abt yesterdays episode? because yes sure ideally he should've comforted her I agree but based on the situation he was in I also understand why he didn't considering he got surprised by the votes, then criticised by literally all of the guys and huda was pretty upset and mad too... like ideally yes he should have in the perfect scenario but I also get that it was a lot for him to take in one night and he seems like someone who has to process his thoughts etc first before actually talking it out yk. i had a bf like that too and i would get so upset if he didn't want to talk shit out immediately but he just needed time to process. either way my point is yes i agree fs that he isn't the man for her because they just communicate differently but I don't think it is fair to blame him for how he handled it because people just deal w such situations differently and its not necessarily wrong?! they're just not made for each other loll",2,1750270653.0,Hour_Employer2190,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion

TBH I think he was emotionally irritated by her with the way she just talks to him and he started getting the ick. I don't know why he didn't put in more effort though but I think he was pulling back for some time,2,1750214657.0,BigFalconRocketMan,1le5pnn,Season 7 - Episode 14 - Post Episode Discussion
