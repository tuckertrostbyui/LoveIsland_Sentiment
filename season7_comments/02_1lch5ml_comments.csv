"My takeaways from this episode :

\- Hannah caused her own heartbreak when she kissed Pepe last night

\- Charlie wanting to explore things with Amaya was desperation clearly.

\- Taylor stayed because of his connections with others and Huda because of that ‚Äúsisterhood‚Äù

\- Huda and Jeremiah getting at it at night when they‚Äôre not even official was crazy 

\- Amaya didn‚Äôt want to hurt her best friend but still did, probably thinking she was giving her a favor ?

\- Olandria doesn‚Äôt seem that interested in Jalen but Taylor isn‚Äôt better so good for her 

\- Iris was collateral damage and unfortunately got coupled up with someone she didn‚Äôt really connect with

\- Huda is delusional

\- Olandria saying we see things they don‚Äôt will probably lead to a lot of self reflection between the couples (which means more drama)

\- Nic was low-key hypocrite for calling Huda out like this so it‚Äôs probably going to get back to him",37,1750047523.0,Fantastic_Try_9174,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

Meanwhile the only reason Taylor has been doing things for Olandria recently is bc she‚Äôs his only option for not getting eliminated. He‚Äôs not even attracted to that absolutely gorgeous girl (which makes 0 sense btw he ain‚Äôt even cute esp compared to Ola). Olandria is defo gonna pick Jalen‚Äôs fine ass and as she should, so there‚Äôs no point of Taylor staying in the villa besides dick-riding Ace.

"Couple of quick thoughts. Olandria did not seem excited to kiss Jalen or giddy after the fact. I could see her truly being a slow burn and can imagine with the way she is shaped she got tired of men always trying to be physical with her quickly. People who want a man to be seen smothering her could be projecting what they want more than what she wants.

Amaya sending Charlie home makes sense if she thought Hannah was iffy on him. If they are close in the villa it would make sense that she knew Hannah had been kissing Pepe at every chance. 

I see some people looking for hidden motives for why the guys voted for Huda. To do that you have to skip by the obvious, she comes across as the crazy possessive girlfriend.

Also, Huda telling Jeremiah a second time that he shouldn't talk about their problems with others when he has her to talk to??

"Offff. That was a drama filled night. 

Taylor really should have been the one to go home but his friendships saved him. Based on the ‚Äúlove‚Äù aspect, Charlie has been trying to make connections and Huda is obsessed with Jeremiah. Taylor is just there to hang with the guys and occasionally chat with Olandria. Taylor and Olandria had the weakest connection of all three couples and I really don‚Äôt see her leaving her bombshell to go back to him, the way I could the other two relationships. 

I wonder if Hannah is going to be mad at Amaya that she was the final vote to send Charlie home? I feel like I‚Äôm not going to like Pepe much so lowkey hate that he‚Äôs the reason Charlie is gone. The flash of Hannah crying and holding photos of Charlie was so beautifully tragic. I hope she has a lot of fun and bounces from guy to guy now.

I can't believe the way people are acting after only 10 days.

They are so afraid of not being seen as a ""girl's girl"" that they're over here making decisions based on who they are friends with. It just doesn't seem genuine at all.

I loved to see Huda cry, and now everyone will be wondering what are we seeing that they aren't. The only person who was straight up was Ace, as much as I dislike him.

"I wonder if the quiet rejection from Pepe hurt Amaya more than she let on to the cameras. Ace basically tanked her standing single-handedly in the villa after she had been pursued by multiple guys - the fall off from desired to reviled, sleeping in a bed by herself because Ace is acting like she's diseased definitely did a number to her self esteem, and probably her emotional stability too. All the girls are either in couples or being actively pursued by guys - Ace is pursuing Chelley right in front of her face, and Hannah, the girl she feels closest too and who she entered the villa with, is also in a close couple with Charlie. 

She said when Pepe came in that she felt excited and invigorated, yet he seemingly dropped her too after one chat, and for Hannah as well! Jalen wasn't paying attention to her, and none of the OG guys stepped up either. She was clearly interested in Pepe, and I wouldn't be surprised if she mentioned it to Hannah, but Hannah really didn't think of her single bestie at all when she decided to, well, play the game and taste test the new bombshell. I honestly wonder if when she made the show of sisterhood to Hannah and emphasizing with Charlie's emotional state, she was reflecting on her own emotions and insecurities and was inwardly hoping Hannah would drop Pepe for her. 

This last bit is definitely overthinking and probably a sign I should go back to working on my fanfic, but I wonder if she a bit of herself and her situation in Charlie and transferred some of her contempt for herself to him. Like she was a couple days ago, Charlie is emotionally spiraling from a failed coupling without steady ground in the villa. Like she was, Charlie is getting desperate for connection. Amaya sobs to the camera about how lost in the experience she feels; maybe, in some way, dumping Charlie felt like giving him the relief she couldn't give herself.",21,1750056397.0,Throwayaaaah,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

Amaya and Ace STILL being in a couple all while hating each other is truly sending me! üòÇ

Chelley and Austin have me exhausted and bored. And I fear Chelley might check out of the experience if she doesn‚Äôt make a connection within the next week or so‚Ä¶

Poor Cierra and Nic get 0 camera time so who knows what‚Äôs really going on with them at the moment. 

Everyone seems to think that Hannah will get over Charlie quickly and give Pepe a shot, but I honestly think she‚Äôs going to have the Ick from her own guilt and she wont be able to connect with Pepe on an emotional level, but I could be wrong‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt see a genuine connection happening with Jeremiah and Iris ESPECIALLY while Huda is still in the villa. Iris already said she‚Äôs gotten the ick and she seems genuinely interested in getting to know Ace. 

Jeremiah and Huda‚Ä¶ oh boy. Poor Jeremiah. The shit he‚Äôs about to go through because of this recoupling, i‚Äôm truly scared for his well-being üò≠ Jeremiah will NEVER be able to explore other connections while Huda is present in the Villa UNLESS she decides to explore too. 

Im curious to see where Olandria and Jalen‚Äôs connection goes. I hope he continues to give our girl the attention she deserves. Don‚Äôt let us down Jalen!! 

Taylor should have gone home!! he‚Äôs made no effort with Olandria or the other girls. That man is on a free vacation and trying to stay as long as he can‚Ä¶.

I reallyyyy hope they bring in a bombshell for Austin, Love island done made me care for this man üòíüòÇ

"Finally on my first night off after my four 12 hour shifts. I just finished...That was rough.

It started out so fun. Olandria's face when she left the Got Wood cabin with Jeremiah holding the door was hilarious. I may add a screen grab here later. She looked like...a Black and yassified version of the mask/digital alteration Aphex Twin did of his face on Windowlicker.

I don't know how I feel about taking the choice away when it was, by game convetions, women's advantage, but I'll come for that, undoubtedly jowly, neck of patriarchal production in another forum.

This is going to be terrible. Also I feel bad for the bombshells. But I guess this is part of the meta-narrative of Love Island.

The preview of Hannah looking at Charlie's picture from the photo booth. And her and Olandria both saying that they really aren't interested in men who engage them physically more than emotionally (Hannah) or intellectually (Olandria, my sapiosexual QUEEN!)

This was a mess. I may be concussed. Making them decide under pressure like that, too.

"My personal opinions: Amaya didn‚Äôt make sense with claiming to be a sister to Hannah, but then sending Hannah‚Äôs man home during the vote. Additionally, didn‚Äôt Huda call her a bitch during a previous challenge? That would stir me the wrong way as well as Huda kissing Ace during another challenge and saying two different things about why she kissed him to both Ace and Amaya at the time. However, I digress, I found her vote to be confusing. Now, at the same time, Hannah kept going back to Pepe after the challenge this episode and straddled him the previous episode, doing the absolute most with him. And I am not judging because that‚Äôs the point of love island, but now that Charlie‚Äôs been voted off, you‚Äôve made your bed, now hump in it. I personally voted for Cierra, but I don‚Äôt blame others for voting for Hannah because of her actions last episode. It didn‚Äôt seem like she was sticking with Charlie and was just hot-cold about it. I am very sad about Charlie leaving, felt like he was very level headed compared to other islanders.

"I agree with the comments. I wish Taylor had gone home, as he has a really good friendship with Olandria but the chemistry is not there. 

The Olandria kisses with Nic and Jeremiah were quite hot! I also liked how she was surprised by the Austin kiss. 

Pepe and Hannah do have great chemistry, there's a really relaxed feeling that Pepe brings to just being with  her. I am not sure they could actually last, but Charlie definitely doesn't have the same relaxed approach. The way he really spun out towards other women as a reaction was a bit much for me, he didn't quite seem to know how to channel his feelings. 

That being said those last moments between Charlie and Hannah felt out of a Song for Achilles, just so epically tragic.

I understand where Nic and Ace are coming from, but it feels icky to vote for Huda. It felt them trying to be the top dogs with the mindset towards Jeremiah of ""we know what's best for you"". To me they both should have voted for Taylor, particularly because their reasoning of ""not exploring"" could be given to him.",28,1750048090.0,sparkling-spirit,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

8.	‚Å†My theory for the whole Amaya and Charlie conversation was that Charlie knew that Pepe was taking his girl, and that he had a high chance of ending up single and being dumped from the villa, so he tried to couple up with the Amaya. He knows that she‚Äôs also single and at risk of being dumped, so he assumed that she would be desperate to stay in the villa and would easily agree a couple up with him.

reflecting on the recoupling & dumping last night and i actually really don‚Äôt like that format. i think voting on couples is interesting but i think pairing it with the dumping in that way sent a message that they‚Äôll be penalized for exploring other connections. not that no one‚Äôs ever been voted off for similar reasons before but having your partner dumped because you had some initial sparks with a bombshell after being in the villa like four days feels really different than someone getting voted out because they were being shady and dishonest with their partner. i feel like it‚Äôs going to push this mentality of people wanting to be married off and be the perfect couple day one with no exploration even further.,28,1750072956.0,berniessander,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

"I feel like the whole push to explore connections instead of be closed off is not only a testament to how the contestants this season play the game but it's also a testament to their relationship styles and behaviors

Nic was literally in an open, long distance relationship prior to being on the show; of course he is motivated by exploring connections to emphasize the strength of a relationship because this is the justification of open relationships-- hooking up with others makes our specific connection stronger. 

Ace has expressed that his strategy is making women want him. He's never told a woman that he loves them. He picked Amaya it seems because he was never wanting to close things off with her and he chose her because he thought she would be the most okay with that and then proceeds to explore his connection with Chelly and then turns around and focuses on Iris to try and make Chelly want him more. It seems like his beef with Huda also stems from her kissing both Jeremiah and him, but then choosing Jeremiah; when it came to the secret kiss challenge, he also kissed Huda in secret and then stirred the pot. 

Jeremiah seems to have had his past relationship end due to circumstances related to cheating so it makes sense that he doesn't want to be defined by past mistakes and doesn't want to continue those mistakes as he starts things off with Huda. 

It has come out that Taylor's last relationship was put on hold so he could go on the show to further his modeling career. It makes sense that he isn't that physical with Olandria, he has a whole girl waiting for him at home in the back of his mind. He's just trying to be on the island as long as he can be. 

Austin, I will say, seems probably the most secure and grounded of the bunch. While he is looking for some kind of validation from Chelly, he really does just take the backseat and doesn't force her to make any kind of choice.",23,1750088371.0,Capital-Show3901,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

"Huda‚Äôs behavior is beyond toxicity: it has characteristics of emotional abuse and manipulation.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†refusing to listen to jeremiah

America did Jeremiah a favor. Huda‚Äôs behavior isn‚Äôt even funny anymore; it‚Äôs concerning.

She has a strong fear of abandonment and anxious attachment that can be dangerous for both her and her daughter. I don‚Äôt know Huda well enough to judge her character, but we can all tell that she needs help, not cameras.

"A few thoughts:
1) I am shocked that a few days ago these posts were filled with comments encouraging a Jeremiah vote for iris‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments saying it wasn‚Äôt necessary and too messy. This just confuses me. Do people now feel bad for saying they should be separated bc of the reactions in the villa? Or are we just seeing new people speak up..?
2) I do feel for iris, but I also wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to see her w ace bc he is the worst in the villa to me, and idk if I really felt her connecting w anyone else! Hopefully she can get a new bombshell soon or something, but unfortunately I do think this outcome will shine light on Huda and Jeremiah‚Äôs relationship and that is good (although messy) at the moment.
3) I do like taylor, he is goofy and makes me giggle‚Ä¶ however he should not have stayed over Charlie or huda even. He‚Äôs not strong enough with ola, and not bringing enough otherwise.
4) I feel for hannah bc yes she did do what an islander should do. I think she was also moving a bit hastily w Pepe and not communicating w Charlie honestly enough‚Ä¶ however.. Simultaneously, I don‚Äôt like how Charlie pulled Amaya to seemingly get back at hannah. But I also understand that Hannah‚Äôs playing the game so he was like, I can do it too. There‚Äôs a lot of truths I see here. Hannah doesn‚Äôt have to be painted as the bad guy, Charlie had his flaws through that, but ultimately Hannah‚Äôs entertainment of the new bombshell helped lead people to vote Charlie off. I‚Äôm not convinced they would do that if Charlie & hannah had been good without bombshell exploration",11,1750049339.0,Quinnietakes,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

Unpopular opinion: but I don‚Äôt think Ace is attracted or wants to be with Huda at all! Keep in mind we only see 5 to 10% of Huda‚Äôs crazy shenanigans with Jeremiah. The rest of the villa is around them 24/7 so God knows what they‚Äôre putting up with and witnessing and they‚Äôre probably sick and tired of it.  The girls are being girls girls and they‚Äôre not going to talk a lot of shit because they saw how season six turned out when the girls stayed besties with each other the entire time. I just feel like Ace and Nick are annoyed about how Huda is just putting a damper on Jeremiah‚Äôs experience on the show and I‚Äôm glad they have the balls to say something about it. As much as I don‚Äôt like Ace as a romantic connection with ANYBODY, he‚Äôs entertaining as hell for the show! He says funny things, and I‚Äôm sorry his laughing at the fire pit when the voting results were announced was hilarious. I busted out laughing when he did üòÇIt‚Äôs weird because Ace says everything America‚Äôs thinking, but he‚Äôs getting so much hate and people are insinuating that he wants her for himself?!

She looked insane standing in front of the fire pit lol

Im starting to feel like some of the logistics have been making the vibes all weird... there's been almost too many challenges and not enough dates which is why the couples that we have dont feel endearing enough, and if the producers were smart they would pick up on that asap and make some dates happen. I think if the couples went out of the villa it would help them with their connection bc they can develop on their own with out the noise, and we would get to see them connect emotionally not just physically 

For example a lot of the bombshells that have come in so far would have been more likely to behave how they wanted if they were 1-1 with the person or persons they wanted to connect with, and not really have to worry about certain ppl (HUDA) being passive agressive with them. 

Also kind of off topic but i feel like chelley is self sabatoging herself, she didnt want to pursue charlie, her connection with ace is very fleeting and deep down she knows that, austin likes her but he isnt speaking her love language/ isnt trying bc he sees her energy being pulled elsewhere, and she isnt trying to connect with the male bombshells.",18,1750040220.0,nicolethewinemom,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

I mean, I‚Äôm not trying to assume anyone‚Äôs sexuality (buttt I‚Äôm gonna), but it‚Äôs Love Island, and Taylor is either asexual or has a girlfriend because like, I‚Äôm a woman, and even I recognize how attractive she is.  Get him off my screen. 

Hannah is matched with Pepe, and since I voted for him and Cierra, my conscience is clear, but all of you should be ashamed, honestly. 

Then the best moment ‚Äî announcing Jeremiah for Huda.  Olandria, ‚ÄúThat is messy AF.‚Äù Yes, yes it is ‚Äî AND WE‚ÄôLL DO IT AGAIN.  Ace cackling was all of us (Insert Luann de Lesseps, Can you believe it girls!) ‚Äî Huda is BIG mad.  ‚ÄúThe people who voted for this,‚Äù or whatever she said ‚Äî like literally all of America, but okay, go off sis. 

Amaya pleading to not vote like someone is murdering her family ‚Äî just the cherry on top.  If she doesn‚Äôt win this show an Emmy, nothing will.  Then to vote off Charlie? That is cold.  I feel like the only reason is that TayTay is so unremarkable that she forgot he was an option, OR maybe she wants him herself (just came up with this theory as I‚Äôm typing, so I‚Äôll need to workshop it more). 

Maybe I‚Äôm weird for loving the mess ‚Äî I‚Äôll work that out with my therapist tomorrow, but I love a good dumpster fire. First 10/10 episode this season.",18,1750043703.0,Ginger_Spice412,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

"Someone asked me why I think Jeremiah is worse than Huda and these are my thoughts:

Jeremiah gave game player to me right away. He was all in on Huda before she was for him. He started the whole ‚Äúhis head isn‚Äôt turning talk‚Äù and Huda followed suit. If Huda didn‚Äôt have a child, he would have kept up the sweet talk because he wanted the win.

However, it‚Äôs very clear he‚Äôs unhappy with Huda being a mother. Which is fine and understandable but just end it. I feel like he‚Äôs only staying because he‚Äôs worried he‚Äôd look bad for dumping her for being a mom. As a result, his energy has completely switched up which Huda has clearly noticed but every time she brings it up he acts like she‚Äôs crazy (she is but not with this). He speaks down to her, told her to shut up, and gave her a single uncooked pancake when she asked for more effort. Mind you all the men cook together so it was intentional when he did that.

Huda is clearly spiraling but I truly think most of it (not all) is because Jeremiah set the standard of this relationship being so strong from the get go and has clearly switched up but won‚Äôt be honest with her about it.",19,1750046208.0,Curlingby,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

I don't like her, but the ppl who are doing that shit and hating on an extra level are WEIRD and LOSERS.

4 Jeremiah and Huda relationship is purely based off lust and insecurity and narcissistic manipulation. The whole country can see that. They have a lot to learn about themselves and if they remain together it will remain unhealthy. 

6. Chelley is insecure I think and wants multiple guys to want her. She‚Äôs a queen and needs a mature guy but she‚Äôs working with literally children so she needs more options so we can actually see her with butterflies. 

7. Austin has such a likable personality. He‚Äôs a lover boy and he wants a boo really bad. I want to see him form a genuine connection so he can express his true lover boy self. Chelley is using him for a safe spot from eliminations.

\- i do not like nic. he is two-faced to huda; so friendly to her face but criticizes her behind her back to jeremiah and the other boys.. he needs to grow a backbone and say that shit to her face. also did not like that he was lowkey judging hannah for kissing pepe... this is the same man who kissed belle-a and cierra 5 mins a part... also not telling either of them what happened. double-standard much? 

\- hannah was not ""exploring"" with pepe she was just horny. i don't think they had a single conversation from what was shown. if you want someplace to make out with people with no repercussions, love island is not the place babe.

\- chelley please do not give ace anymore attention oh my godddddd please im begging.

"Unpopular opinion: we need to unpack the audiences internalised misogyny.

The double standards between huda and ace is crazy.

Huda is annoying, huda is obsessive and huda is clingy and yes, the way she talks to women who threaten her relationship with J is not okay.

But she doesn‚Äôt enjoy making people feel small, worthless, and humiliating them nor does she believe in red pilll BS.

The only thing she‚Äôs guilty of, is finding a man who can match her crazy. J and huda feed off each other with toxicity. J is not innocent, they both love bombed each other and when your both having sex every night, of course the obsession will continue.

It‚Äôs obvious Huda has emotional regulation problems and is not okay. I don‚Äôt think she should be in love island at all for her mental health problems, already people be coming on her exes page and baby daddy page spewing hate.

But, Huda doesn‚Äôt enjoy or take pleasure in humiliating people, or making them feel worthless, like ace does.

What ace did with Amaya and Huda right now is very toxic. It‚Äôs actually make them feel worthless and feel like shit. Ace didn‚Äôt do that conversation decoupling to ‚Äútell the truth‚Äù but more to humiliate Huda.

But because the audience always hates women, they obviously gonna take joy in the bullying of a woman, especially by a man who has made a lot of problematic statements to women, especially POC women.",29,1750044974.0,Prudent-Experience-3,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

"Soo many thoughts but this episode had my jaw on the floor. I didn‚Äôt expect someone to leave rn with no deliberation. Shoutout to Ariana for having a straight face the whole time bc I would‚Äôve been shook. Okay so:

1. I‚Äôm confused on the Amaya hate, especially this episode. While I think people have been on Ace too hard, I get it. But Amaya?? This episode showed that she‚Äôs really just sensitive and feels things deeply. Im not mad at her at all this episode and it‚Äôs actually very real of her to tell Charlie he‚Äôs acting out of frustration and turned him down. 

2. Hannah and Charlie‚Äôs convo before the dumping was rough bc ik more people voted for her to be with Pepe. And it‚Äôs gonna suckkkkk when the girls find out about that conversation in depth. But honestly I don‚Äôt blame them bc in their eyes Hannah was feeling Pepe a bit more and Charlie was pissed. My vote would‚Äôve been for Taylor, no shade. But I hope this puts a fire in him to try harder with Olandria.

3. Jalen‚Ä¶he seems like a sweetheart, I hope we see deeper conversations with him and Olandria bc rn it‚Äôs not given strong connection, rather she‚Äôs interested bc he‚Äôs doing what she wanted from Taylor. But we will see. 

4. The mom and dad are having a forced separationü´¢. Sorry Huda girl. Tbh I said in another post that I voted for Jeremiah and iris bc I was curious to see if he really was into Huda. It was started to feel like he was getting tired of her. And considering how deep in thought he was after nics comments about her, him voluntarily kissing Olandria bc he wanted to show people he could have fun, it‚Äôs giving he wants to explore a bit. I don‚Äôt doubt he likes Huda but he‚Äôs there to find his person too and deserves to explore without it being a big issue. That secret can‚Äôt keep him unless he wants to be kept so we will see. 

5. I hope Huda explores too! Ik she loves (she‚Äôs slipped up too many times for it to be an accident) that man and I get it. But girl needs to be sure he‚Äôs the one, and in this house, she won‚Äôt know unless she gives someone else a chance, even a little bit. I hope now the mommy secret just comes out, but I feel like atp it can‚Äôt? Idk! Now it‚Äôs too complicated!

6. This is all entertaining but I feel for them like this is emotional turmoil in such a confined space. They are still real people on a show so I do empathize with their feelings. BUT!

Dude has no physical chemistry with Olandria and she was smiling from ear to ear when America made the recoupling choice for her to be with Jalen for her

She‚Äôs just really not that into him and he does not have game and trust me everyone in the villa knows but chooses to ignore it

"She was never going to vote for a girl, so Huda was safe. And voting for Cowboy (sorry ... I can't remember his name right now, lol ... but he should have been the one to go) would just result in a 3-way tie.

They weren't giving great tv though for me, until this episode. I was here for Hannah telling him not to do tit for tat shit. But I also really liked that last conversation. As someone who finds men that come on strong physically a real turn off, I really related to Hannah for the first time as she was having that epiphany with Amaya about how Charlie is really trying to connect with her, whereas Pepe is connecting with her body. It can take a long time gain that discernment and I just really enjoyed seeing that...not knowing what was to come of course.

"I'm always so confused about hate messages directed at specific people, especially when it gets to the level of finding outside people in their life to harass too. Like, what is going on in someone's life that compels them to do that? 

I've seen some times where celebrities confront someone who said something bad and the person is always like ""I didn't think you'd actually see it"" so why do it?? What do you get out of it?

I know an excuse is often like well they signed up for the show knowing they'll get hate, but that doesn't explain why it becomes so personal. They should expect fans generally laughing about their insane behavior amongst each other on reddit and twitter. They should not have to expect people directing hate towards them and other people in their life.",6,1750116336.0,bulbasauuuur,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion
"I get the point, and I agree that online hate is disgusting, people forget there‚Äôs a real person behind the screen. But I think we need to stop repeating the idea that Sophie, Mike, and Caroline took their own lives **because of Love Island.** That‚Äôs not the full story.

Sophie had been open about her long-term struggles with mental health well before the show. Mike was going through personal challenges, including the loss of his grandmother and financial stress. Caroline was dealing with intense media pressure, legal issues, and a relationship ending. None of these situations can be reduced to ‚Äúthey were bullied online and that‚Äôs why they died.‚Äù

Pushing this one-sided narrative might feel like raising awareness, but it actually does the opposite. It strips away their real stories and turns complex human lives into a blameable headline.",22,1750115439.0,Advanced-Trainer508,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion
"Here‚Äôs the thing. No one deserves abuse but any stretch - however the truth is that‚Äôs why they are there. They are ‚Äúthere‚Äù for love but they are really there for notoriety. Unfortunately for them, they aren‚Äôt in control of their message and that is clear from the outset. So it‚Äôs up to them - within production guidelines - to control how they are presented. And it is the risk they take - production needs to make a show that people want to watch. Reality tv is never ‚Äúnice‚Äù.  

Think about Austin. He was kinda creepy early on. But as he‚Äôs gotten more comfortable has evolved and you can tell he‚Äôs well liked. 

Huda is another story. There s definitely angst around her. And it‚Äôs her story and she‚Äôs created her situation which is pretty ugly. She‚Äôs controlling. She‚Äôs mean. She‚Äôs reactive. And manipulative. And you can see it in both the girls (definitely eyerolling) and guys. That‚Äôs what she‚Äôs decided is her role and as viewers it IS what we see. And most people don‚Äôt like it.

"Who in your mind has potential, legitimately asking, not arguing. 

Jer/Huda: unhealthy & manipulative 

Nic/Cierra: seems like fun but not serious potential past the show, he was already head turning for Iris.

Austin/Chelley: she doesn't like him, he can't handle it. They should cut it and stay platonic.

Chelley/Ace: Ace played himself by not picking her, and now is in love with Iris, his head is easily turned 

Ace/Amaya: no explanation needed. 

Tay/Olandria: he doesn't like her. He feels threatened by Jalen bc it would mean Tay would go home, not bc Jalen could take Olandria.

Charlie/Hannah: Hannah jumped ship so quick for PePe. Charlie had no other connections, he needed to go 

Hannah/Pepe: no depth, just physical.

Jalen/Olandria: may work, too soon to tell rn

"I‚Äôve never been in hudas shoes I‚Äôve been in Jeremiah‚Äôs tho and enabled that behaviour thinking it was cute, I think there‚Äôs obviously a lot of grace that should be given to islanders and a bigger chop at the producers for letting people like Huda and Jeremiah join this experiment. People only see the good parts, the fame and the clout and not actually how previous islanders who also had villain arcs mental health derailed after leaving. I think that‚Äôs what this show lacks and yes Huda is an adult and by no means should others make that decision for her but she also isn‚Äôt aware of public perception and producers should protect her by atleast making this short. The more I grow up the more I realise how normal it is for some people to dehumanise others behind a screen, no matter how much I don‚Äôt like a person on a tv show, that‚Äôs all it is to me, a show.

"I think it will depend on two things: 

 
1. If Producers consider the single islanders from last night a ‚Äúbottom three‚Äù or not. Since usually islanders eliminated by a vote are part of the bottom three in popularity

2. If Hannah keeps mentioning Charlie throughout the next week to islanders and/or producers

 
Molly Marsh was brought back in S10 because she was eliminated after a bombshell had to pick a guy at the end of their first day and picked her partner. So she was eliminated without any public input and not because she was in the bottom of the vote so it felt vastly unfair to viewers. 

Also, she was brought back because Zach kept telling the boys and producers that he wasn‚Äôt really feeling Kady and didn‚Äôt think it compared to Molly and that he couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her or talking about her. Granted, we as viewers did not know this second part until after the season was over and they started doing podcast interviews as they didn‚Äôt include him pining for Molly in the edit on the show in that week where she was gone. 

Thus I really think it will come down to if producers consider what they did a fair elimination (and if they care about that poll on the app where ~90% of voters thought the islanders picked wrong), and if Hannah moves on from Charlie in a real meaningful way (not a half hearted attempt like Zach did). 

If you consider they didn‚Äôt bring back Andrea last year for Rob and he clearly didn‚Äôt like anyone after her I‚Äôm leaning Charlie is really gone, BUT Andrea was in a bottom three so it‚Äôs different in that regard that she was not liked by the public and they probably thought she had a fair shot and her going was justified by the public.

"Non-consent?  Hmm... I don't agree.  What they agreed to was to come on a show where ""couplings"" are part of the games.  Since the beginning, there have been people who were last to get chosen stuck with someone they didn't want to be with, or bombshells have chosen people who didn't really want to be chosen.

That is THIS show.  You don't have to touch the person you're coupled up with.  Like Ace, and many before him, you don't even have to sleep with them.  I hear what you're getting at, but these are adults who chose to be on the show, and follow the fairly basic rules.  

If something goes beyond, producers will step in.  People are also always free to leave, and people have been kicked out.  I think people can get too precious about some of these shows.  We're watching people with tongues in the mouths of different people, every week.  This show is well established, if it's not for you, you have the option to not sign up.

Not necessarily you, but people looking for fairytale love, with no complications, or roadblocks on an actual game show, are being unrealistic.",20,1750071715.0,Tanmb11,1lch5ml,Season 7 - Episode 12 - Post Episode Discussion

Jeremiah isn't much better. He has made several references to thinking they could win the game. He's sticking with Huda because he's afraid he's gonna get kicked out if he doesn't have her as his ""ride or die"" partner.

"Regardless of your point about the comment, it‚Äôs very obvious Taylor is not into her. The second she addressed the lack of physical touch and wanting to feel desired last wk, he kisses her and is tonguing her down in the photo booth immmmediately after? That was so inorganic and forced, that was clearly an effort to try to appease her. A true slow burner wouldn‚Äôt tongue you down the second after a conversation was had. 

That man doesn‚Äôt flirt with her, he doesn‚Äôt look at her endearingly, or compliment her. When he planned the salsa lesson, he said he did so since Ace did something for Chelley (tf?). They act like great friends and that‚Äôs it. Even in tonight‚Äôs episode his confessionals lack feelings. He just mentioned he needs to continue to show effort to ‚Äúkeep‚Äù Olandria. He speaks nothing about how she makes him feel or what he likes about her.

I also could see Jeremiah love bombing her to an extent, but I feel like they honestly love bombed each other. I've been love bombed before and then triangled by the love bomber to make me jealous and insecure. Maybe that is what is happening with Huda and Jeremiah, OR Huda has had that happen in the past and is reacting poorly to this experience because she is not healed from past experiences. She is clearly NOT ready to find love because someone who was ready to find love would be confident in themself and not be so insecure.
